# **REDTEN**

A symbolic algebra package for **REDUCE** which
provides tensor and tensor-like objects and
manipulation functions for work in General
Relativity.

## Release

- This is **REDTEN** v4.4 (*Nov 10/09*),
  tested with **REDUCE** 3.7 and 3.8

## Notes

- The `help` command is present in **REDTEN**,
  which unfortunately will conflict with the new
  **REDUCE** `help` command
  
  - At some point, the **REDTEN** help will be
    merged.
