This Reduce script evaluates the Ricci tensor for the Kerr metric 
in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates to show that the metric is  indeed
a  vacuum  solution.  The  total cpu running-time on a SUN 3/160 
is about 2 min 12 sec. 

Below is the line-element for the metric. The functions  delta(r)
and  rho2(r,th) will remain unevaluated until the Ricci tensor is
computed, however, the derivatives of  these  functions  will  be
evaluated. 
;
ds := - delta/rho2*(d(t)-a*sin(th)^2*d(ph))^2
   + sin(th)^2/rho2*((r^2+a^2)*d(ph)-a * d(t))^2
   + rho2/delta * d(r)^2+rho2*d(th)^2;
comment
Define the  general  functions  delta(r),  rho2(r,th)  and  their
derivatives.
;
depend delta,r;
depend rho2,r,th;
let df(rho2,r) = 2*r;
let df(delta,r) = 2*r-2*m;
let df(rho2,th) = -2*a^2*sin(th)*cos(th);

Compute the metric tensor from the line-element, and simplify the 
inverse metric.

Compute the first  and  second  Christoffel  symbols.  The  first
Christoffel  symbols  are  symmetric  in  their  first and second
indices, the second Christoffel symbols are  symmetric  in  their
second and third indices, and have a contravariant first index.

Compute the fully covariant Riemann curvature tensor. This object 
has the full Riemann symmetry.

Compute  the  fully  covariant  Ricci  tensor.  This  object   is
symmetric in its two indices.

Display the first non-zero (unsimplified) component of the  Ricci
tensor.

Now define the functions delta(r) and rho2(r,th).
;
let delta = r^2 - 2*m*r + a^2;
let rho2 = r^2 + a^2 * cos (th)^2;

Simplify the Ricci tensor with the above definitions.
