3) let's do not evaluate (i.e call simp) on their args, so an indexed
object reference is not fully evaluated. the code seems to take a
different route depending on whether there is a power involved or not,
so something like let q[1] = 0 will get messed up, whereas let q[1]^2
= 0 is ok. if one needs the former kind of let rule, just assign it
instead. 

6) Putting depends on implicit objects means the name cannot be used
by itself as an identifier, because it will still have dependencies.

INdexed depends should be separate from the usual scalar ones.

must do fast-writetnsr-cleanup in evaltnsr so that calling routines
can see neat tvalue and eg detect a zero object.
df(gam,x[a]) -> 0
