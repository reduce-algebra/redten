- Similarly, the print function for derivs of indexed objects does not
do a great job printing these ops. (eg df(k[a],o,p,l) is not sorted
and prints poorly)

- Need a way of specifying the dependencies of the componenets of an
implicit object, since telling the system that, eg, df(k[0],t)=0 is
not possible given the problem of no eval in let rules. (the later part
of this is now possible, jul 30/88)

- assignments like k[0]==l[0]== value,  do not work (use parenthesis).

- how does one remove an assignment to an implicit object? if k[0]==t^2 and
i now want k[0] as it was before, how do i do this???
