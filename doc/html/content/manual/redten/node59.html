    </h1>
    <p>
      <a name="entend" id="entend"></a> From the user perspective REDTEN
      consists of two levels: a lower level of indexed algebra in which the user
      can enter indexed expressions and have them evaluated; and a higher level
      in which the user applies functions that compute objects of interest and
      which maintain the book-keeping in the system. The higher level functions
      are ``layered'' onto the lower level in the same way that REDTEN itself is
      layered onto REDUCE. The packages described in Chapters
      <a href="node33.html#gr">4</a> and
      <a href="node45.html#packages">6</a> are high level functions, but it is
      important to realize that the basic REDTEN indexed algebra engine could be
      used to compute interesting quantites even without these packages, as was
      done in Chapter <a href="node9.html#indexedobj">2</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the development of the GR package is essentially complete, the
      spinor, frame (tetrad), and Newman-Penrose packages require more work. As
      well, there are many other computations that would be useful to have
      automated in high level functions, such as Petrov classification of
      metrics, etc
      <a name="tex2html102" href="footnode.html#2389" id="tex2html102"
        ><img
          align="bottom"
          alt='.png"'
          src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png" /></a
      >. In this sense REDTEN is incomplete: there are always other interesting
      objects to compute, in other formalisms etc., which would be convenient
      (but not absolutely necessary) to have high level functions to deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
      This appendix describes how the user can extend REDTEN by writing
      functions to automate the computation of specific indexed objects. It is
      assumed that the user has a basic understanding of RLISP and lisp in
      general. NOTE: Although the user is free to modify or extend REDTEN as
      required, no such modified copy may be redistributed without the
      modifications being plainly marked, and the copy must not be
      misrepresented as the original. If you have a brilliant addition, send it
      to the authors to be included in the distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the programmers perspective, there are actually three levels in
      REDTEN: a ``basement'' level of basic functions lies under the low level
      (the division is somewhat blurry). Some of these functions are required
      when writing high level code, as they deal with the mundane details of
      maintaining indexed objects in the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example of writing high level function, we shall use the riemann()
      function of the GR package as a starting point. All of the high level
      functions work in the same basic fashion: they write an indexed expression
      the equivalent of what the user would type and cause it to be evaluated.
      The complications come with all of the other book-keeping functionality
      required. Before actually detailing the structure of a typical high level
      function, consideration must first be given to the internal representation
      of an indexed object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user interface to an indexed object consists of a name followed by an
      index enclosed in square brackets. The indexed object name has another
      property not mentioned in ยง<a href="node19.html#sseciobprops">2.2.6</a>:
      the simpfn propert gives the name of an RLISP function to execute when the
      algebraic simplifier encounters the name. All indexed objects are handled
      by the same function (mkrdr()) which receives both the object name and the
      separately parsed index as arguments. This function then constructs the
      internal ``<span class="c1">rdr</span>-form'' of an indexed object; it
      also handles some error checking and display requests (see ยง<a
        href="node28.html#ssecaccess"
        >2.4.3</a
      >).
    </p>
    <p>
      Internally, an indexed object (after parsing) is a lisp list whose first
      element (the car()) is the ``function'' <span class="c1">rdr</span
      ><a name="tex2html103" href="footnode.html#4175" id="tex2html103"
        ><img
          align="bottom"
          alt='.png"'
          src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"
      /></a>
      which itself has a simpfn property pointing to the RLISP function
      simprdr(). The simprdr() function supervises the read-out of object
      componenets if the index is fixed, and returns an unevaluated
      <span class="c1">rdr</span>-form otherwise. The second element (cadr()) of
      the <span class="c1">rdr</span>-form is the indexed object name, and the
      third (caddr()) is the index, containing the internal forms of any index
      operators. A fourth element is no longer used, but some REDTEN code may
      still make a harmless reference to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various index operators are all translated into an internal form when
      they are parsed as shown in table <a href="node59.html#tabintop">A.1</a>.
      The index itself becomes an ordinary lisp list, most operators exist as
      elements at the top level of this list, except for the shift operations
      which become sublists with the operator first, and the index element
      second. Knowing these internal forms the programmer can write any indexed
      expression.

    </p>
    <p>
      To write a high level function first requires an equation defining the
      output indexed object; the definition of the Riemann tensor (equation
      <a href="node29.html#eqriemann">3.3</a>) is repeated here for reference
      with different indices,

    <p>
      Below is the source code for the riemann() function. The function performs
      several basic tasks: determining the name of its output object, checking
      to see if the object already exists, creating it if not, setting up and
      evaluating the indexed expression which computes the output, and some
      book-keeping and cleanup. Each line of the function is described
      separately after.

      <li>
        We first define the default name of the object that this function will
        create. It is conventional in REDTEN to assign this name to the lisp
        varibale with the same name as the user-name of the function, in this
        example <span class="c1">riemann</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the user executes the <span class="c1">riemann()</span>
        function, the REDUCE parser examines the simpfn property of
        <span class="c1">riemann</span> for the name of the actual RLISP
        function to execute. It is conventional in REDTEN to name this function
        by appending a <span class="c1">!*</span> to the user-name (there are
        plenty of violations of this convention, however). Thus, the actual work
        of computing the Riemann tensor is done by the RLISP function
        <span class="c1">riemann!*()</span> (but see ยง<a
          href="node67.html#rename"
          >F.1</a
        >
        for a caveat).
      </li>
      <li>
        A function called in this way receives a single argument which is a list
        of all actual arguments given in the function call (note the arguments
        should not be quoted). This statement begins the actual definition of
        the function (or ``procedure'' in REDUCE terminology).
      </li>
      <li>
        Various local variables will be required, which should be declared here,
        otherwise they will become ``fluid'' when this function is compiled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The mycar() function is similar to the standard lisp car() function,
            except that it works with <span class="c1">nil</span> as well, i.e.
            <span class="c1">mycar(nil)</span>
            <img align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6450.png" />
            <span class="c1">nil</span> (in many lisps
            <span class="c1">car ('nil)</span> is an error because
            <span class="c1">nil</span> is an atom). The mycar() function (and
            its siblings) are used throughout the REDTEN code, even where their
            enhanced functionality is not required. Thus,
            <span class="c1">mycar(u)</span> is the argument to
            <span class="c1">riemann()</span>, or <span class="c1">nil</span> if
            none was given.
          </li>
          <li>
            The getnme() function is used to determine the name (and index) of a
            given object from a number of possible formats. The input can be
            just a name, as will be the case here, and either indexed or not; or
            the input can be an <span class="c1">rdr</span>-form, where the
            index may indicate shift operations and the offspring object will be
            created if it does not yet exist. The second argument is a
            dotted-pair the first element of which indicates whether the indexed
            object must already be indexed (i.e. the object is being used for a
            calculation), or can be non-indexed (i.e. it is the name to use when
            creating the output object). The second element of the pair
            indicates if a name is even required (i.e. there is a default
            available). In this example a name is not required, but if one is
            given it need not be indexed. The last argument to getnme() is
            simply the name of the calling function, for use in error messages.
          </li>
          <li>
            The return from getnme() is a list of two elements: the first is the
            object name, the second is its index. Thus,
            <span class="c1">tnsr</span> is assigned the name the user typed (if
            any), and will get the value <span class="c1">nil</span> if no name
            was given. Any index is ignored. If an index was attached to the
            input name, that name is already indexed, and, if not protected,
            will be destroyed and remade.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        For the current metric the Riemann function stores the name of the
        object it creates on the metric under the key riemann (see line 14). Any
        future calls to riemann() will find and return this name without making
        new calculations <em>if</em> the user did not supply a name (see line
        7). The current tensor metric (returned by getmetric() with an argument
        of 1) is checked for a riemann property, any value found is assigned to
        <span class="c1">lex</span>; <span class="c1">nil</span> is assigned if
        no property exists.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the user does not supply a name to use for the output object, and the
        value found at line 6 is that of an indexed object, that object is
        returned immediately (see line 17 for an explanation of the format of
        the return value). If the user did supply a name for the output object,
        then a new object will be created and the calculations performed, even
        if the same calculation has already been done.
      </li>
      <li>
        The actual name of the output object is determined from the following
        rules: If a name was supplied by the user, then that is the name of the
        new object (the generic Riemann name will also point to it, see
        generics()). If no name was supplied, then the default name (stored on
        riemann) is made into the object name by prepending the name of the
        current tensor metric and an <span class="c1">_</span> character. Thus,
        if the metric has the name <span class="c1">g1</span>, the default name
        of the Riemann tensor created for this metric is
        <span class="c1">g1_R</span>.
        <p>
          newnme() requires two arguments: the user-input name (which may be
          <span class="c1">nil</span>), and the default name (stored in this
          case on riemann, note there is no quote before
          <span class="c1">riemann</span>: its value is passed to the function).
          newnme() also prints the <span class="c1">Computing ...</span> message
          to indicate to the user what the real name of the object will be. The
          generic name for the Riemann tensor will point to this object.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        With the name of the output object stored in
        <span class="c1">tnsr</span> the internal function to create indexed
        object is called (still named mktnsr!*() although it can create any kind
        of indexed object). Its arguments are nearly as described in ยง<a
          href="node11.html#secmkobj"
          >2.2</a
        >, but the symmetry lists are entered in internal format where the block
        size is placed in a sublist in each independent symmetry. The object has
        four covariant tensor indices, a Riemann symmetry, is not implicit, the
        itype is <span class="c1">riemann</span>, and the description string is
        set to something informative.
        <p>
          mkmsg() takes one list, the first is a string containing
          <span class="c1">%</span> symbols. These are replaced in sequence by
          the remaining elements of the list. To print an indexed object wrap
          its <span class="c1">rdr</span>-form with the rdr!-string() function;
          to print a list as an index wrap it with index!-string();
          <span class="c1"><code>\</code>%</span> produces a literal
          <span class="c1">%</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        The printname of the object is changed so that no matter what its real
        name is it is <em>displayed</em> in the same fashion (by default using
        the name <span class="c1">R</span> in this example).
      </li>
      <li>
        Equation <a href="node59.html#Riem">A.1</a> is now used to generate an
        indexed expression that will compute the Riemann tensor. This is written
        in an internal REDUCE format called ``prefix-form''. The result is
        assigned to <span class="c1">lex</span> for use in line 12 (this
        assignment could have been by-passed, writing the expression directly
        into line 12, but the code would be harder to read).
        <p>
          The prefix form involves lisp lists whose first element is an
          algebraic function, which will be applied to the remaining arguments.
          The following functions may be useful in constructing an indexed
          expression:
        </p>
        <p><img align="bottom" src="_10787_tabular2574.png" /></p>
        <p>
          There are two ways to construct a list in lisp: using the quote
          function (the input shorthand is <span class="c1">'</span>) which
          <em>does not</em> evaluate its arguments, and using the function
          list() which <em>does</em> evaluate its arguments. If a list is to be
          written whose contents may vary between one evaluation and the next,
          the list() function must be used. Generally, only numbers will be
          constant as such (for example,
          <img align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6452.png" /> can be
          constructed as <span class="c1">'(quotient 1 2)</span>); even if the
          name of an indexed object is assumed to be known it is better to make
          use of a variable which holds the name, so that the name can easily be
          changed later without affecting the code. Hence, writing indexed
          expressions requires many calls to list(). Notice that the arguments
          to list() must themselves be quoted if they are to be used literally.
          If any sublist is constructed using the list() function, all enclosing
          lists must be constructed the same way (not using the quote function),
          or the sublists will not be evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>Consider the code fragment</p>
        <p>
          <span class="c1"
            >list ('rdr, mycar (christoffel1!* ('nil)), '(b!# d!# a!# !*br
            c!#))</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          which creates an <span class="c1">rdr</span>-form representing the
          first term of equation <a href="node59.html#Riem">A.1</a>. The name to
          be used for the indexed object is found by calling the
          christoffel1!*() function, which works in the same way as the
          riemann!*() function considered here. That is, christoffel1!*() either
          returns the name of the previously computed object, or does the
          computation now. In either case the return value is of the form
          described under line 17, so that mycar() is used to isolate the name.
          This method of having one function call others that it depends on
          allows the user to create all the objects of interest from the metric
          with one command (but see ยง<a href="node42.html#secexpmanage">5.1</a>
          for reasons why this is not usually a good idea).
        </p>
        <p>
          The index can of course be written with specific indices and is thus
          constructed using the quote function. The actual indices are selected
          from those stored in the variable alphalist!* (which is simply a list
          of indices that the user will not use, since algebraic values assigned
          to these symbols could potentially have side-effects). The index is
          written with the internal forms of the index operators as shown in
          table <a href="node59.html#tabintop">A.1</a>; in the example above an
          ordinary differentiation operator has been placed in the index.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shift operations are indicated by making the index-element into a
          sublist with the operator as the first element. For example, an index
          might be written <span class="c1">'(a!# (!*at!* b!#))</span> to
          indicate shifting the second index-element. If the exact
          <span class="c1">indextype</span> of an available object is unknown,
          the absolute shift operators can be used to ensure a canonical form is
          used in the expression. This technique is used in the frame package
          where it is not certain in advance whether the user has defined a
          covariant or contravariant connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examination of the rest of line 11 will show the correspondence with
          the terms of equation <a href="node59.html#Riem">A.1</a>. The repeated
          index <span class="c1">e!#</span> represents a contraction in the two
          products; and note the use of the unary minus to negate the last term.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        The indexed expression in prefix-form is now passwd to the evaluator
        evaltnsr1(). This function is called almost directly when the user makes
        an indexed assignment with <span class="c1">==</span>, and receives the
        name and index of the object on the left-hand side, and the indexed
        expression on the right-hand side. A fourth argument is no longer used.
        It is in this function that the two levels of REDTEN alluded to above
        meet: the riemann!*() function as examined so far exists simply to
        automate the construction of an expression the user could have typed in
        by hand.
        <p>
          When evaltnsr1() finsishes, the output object (whose name is the value
          of <span class="c1">tnsr</span>) will have the appropriate values. If
          showindices is on, then the indices will be displayed as the
          calculation proceeds.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        It is usual to apply a write-protection to the output object to prevent
        the user from accidentally changing components. If modification is
        desired, then the user can clear the protection with protect().
      </li>
      <li>
        The name of the output object is then placed on the property list of the
        current tensor metric under the key <span class="c1">riemann</span>.
        This is checked in line 6 to see if the object has previously been
        computed for this metric. This property is also used by the generic
        object system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lines 15 do a special check; other functions may have similar checks or
        none at all.
        <ol>
          <li>
            The components of the object are stored on the tvalue property. If
            there is no value here, then the object has no explicit components,
            i.e. it is 0. The body of the if statement is enclosed by the
            <span class="c1">&lt;&lt;</span> and
            <span class="c1">&gt;&gt;</span> symbols.
          </li>
          <li>
            In this case an informative message is printed. The tabthenprint()
            function keeps track of the indenting of messages delivered during
            calculations.
          </li>
          <li>
            terpri() simply terminates a line, moving the cursor to the
            beginning of the next.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        A call to cleaner() prints the
        <span class="c1">... finished</span> messages for functions that have
        been called upon to perform work (but not directly by the user), and it
        cleans up temporary objects if this function was called directly by the
        user. Its single argument is the user-name of the function in which it
        is used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, the name of the object is returned. To return a single name to
        the algebraic simplifier it should be in the form of a dotted-pair whose
        first element is the name, and whose second element is 1. Any function
        which calls this one must use <span class="c1">car()</span> to isolate
        the actual object name in the return value.
      </li>
      <li>The function definition ends here.</li>
      <li>
        To interface with the generic name system, a psuedo-object is created by
        makegeneric() which has many of the properties of the actual object. The
        first argument to makegeneric() is the name of the generic object, in
        this case the value of riemann (<span class="c1">R</span>). Recall that
        the name of the actual object is of the form
        <span class="c1">g1_R</span>. The second argument specifies on which
        metric the relation between the generic and actual object will be stored
        (type 1 in this example, i.e. the tensor metric), and under what
        property to look for the relation. In this case, when the generic object
        <span class="c1">R</span> is used, the system will examine the tensor
        metric for the riemann property, and use the object so specified (this
        is the same property used by the riemann!* function itself). The third
        and fourth arguments gives the <span class="c1">indextype</span> and
        symmetries of the generic object; the last argument gives the name of
        the lisp function that can be used to compute the actual object.
