  <P><A name="entend" id="entend"></A> From the user perspective REDTEN
  consists of two levels: a lower level of indexed algebra in which the user
  can enter indexed expressions and have them evaluated; and a higher level
  in which the user applies functions that compute objects of interest and
  which maintain the book-keeping in the system. The higher level functions
  are ``layered'' onto the lower level in the same way that REDTEN itself is
  layered onto REDUCE. The packages described in Chapters <A href=
  "node33.html#gr">4</A> and <A href="node45.html#packages">6</A> are high
  level functions, but it is important to realize that the basic REDTEN
  indexed algebra engine could be used to compute interesting quantites even
  without these packages, as was done in Chapter <A href=
  "node9.html#indexedobj">2</A>.</P>
  <P>Although the development of the GR package is essentially complete, the
  spinor, frame (tetrad), and Newman-Penrose packages require more work. As
  well, there are many other computations that would be useful to have
  automated in high level functions, such as Petrov classification of
  metrics, etc <A name="tex2html102" href="footnode.html#2389" id=
  "tex2html102"><IMG align="bottom" alt=".png&quot;" src=
  "../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A>. In this sense REDTEN is
  incomplete: there are always other interesting objects to compute, in other
  formalisms etc., which would be convenient (but not absolutely necessary)
  to have high level functions to deal with.</P>
  <P>This appendix describes how the user can extend REDTEN by writing
  functions to automate the computation of specific indexed objects. It is
  assumed that the user has a basic understanding of RLISP and lisp in
  general. NOTE: Although the user is free to modify or extend REDTEN as
  required, no such modified copy may be redistributed without the
  modifications being plainly marked, and the copy must not be misrepresented
  as the original. If you have a brilliant addition, send it to the authors
  to be included in the distribution.</P>
  <P>From the programmers perspective, there are actually three levels in
  REDTEN: a ``basement'' level of basic functions lies under the low level
  (the division is somewhat blurry). Some of these functions are required
  when writing high level code, as they deal with the mundane details of
  maintaining indexed objects in the system.</P>
  <P>As an example of writing high level function, we shall use the riemann()
  function of the GR package as a starting point. All of the high level
  functions work in the same basic fashion: they write an indexed expression
  the equivalent of what the user would type and cause it to be evaluated.
  The complications come with all of the other book-keeping functionality
  required. Before actually detailing the structure of a typical high level
  function, consideration must first be given to the internal representation
  of an indexed object.</P>
  <P>The user interface to an indexed object consists of a name followed by
  an index enclosed in square brackets. The indexed object name has another
  property not mentioned in ยง<A href="node19.html#sseciobprops">2.2.6</A>:
  the simpfn propert gives the name of an RLISP function to execute when the
  algebraic simplifier encounters the name. All indexed objects are handled
  by the same function (mkrdr()) which receives both the object name and the
  separately parsed index as arguments. This function then constructs the
  internal ``<SPAN class="c1">rdr</SPAN>-form'' of an indexed object; it also
  handles some error checking and display requests (see ยง<A href=
  "node28.html#ssecaccess">2.4.3</A>).</P>
  <P>Internally, an indexed object (after parsing) is a lisp list whose first
  element (the car()) is the ``function'' <SPAN class="c1">rdr</SPAN><A name=
  "tex2html103" href="footnode.html#4175" id="tex2html103"><IMG align=
  "bottom" alt=".png&quot;" src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A>
  which itself has a simpfn property pointing to the RLISP function
  simprdr(). The simprdr() function supervises the read-out of object
  componenets if the index is fixed, and returns an unevaluated <SPAN class=
  "c1">rdr</SPAN>-form otherwise. The second element (cadr()) of the
  <SPAN class="c1">rdr</SPAN>-form is the indexed object name, and the third
  (caddr()) is the index, containing the internal forms of any index
  operators. A fourth element is no longer used, but some REDTEN code may
  still make a harmless reference to it.</P>
  <P>The various index operators are all translated into an internal form
  when they are parsed as shown in table <A href=
  "node59.html#tabintop">A.1</A>. The index itself becomes an ordinary lisp
  list, most operators exist as elements at the top level of this list,
  except for the shift operations which become sublists with the operator
  first, and the index element second. Knowing these internal forms the
  programmer can write any indexed expression.</P>

  <STRONG>Table A.1:</STRONG> Internal forms of index operators<BR></P>
  <P>To write a high level function first requires an equation defining the
  output indexed object; the definition of the Riemann tensor (equation
  <A href="node29.html#eqriemann">3.3</A>) is repeated here for reference
  with different indices,</P>
  <P><A name="Riem" id="Riem"></A><IMG align="bottom" src=

  <P>Below is the source code for the riemann() function. The function
  performs several basic tasks: determining the name of its output object,
  checking to see if the object already exists, creating it if not, setting
  up and evaluating the indexed expression which computes the output, and
  some book-keeping and cleanup. Each line of the function is described
  separately after.</P>

  <OL>
    <LI>We first define the default name of the object that this function
    will create. It is conventional in REDTEN to assign this name to the lisp
    varibale with the same name as the user-name of the function, in this
    example <SPAN class="c1">riemann</SPAN>.</LI>
    <LI>When the user executes the <SPAN class="c1">riemann()</SPAN>
    function, the REDUCE parser examines the simpfn property of
      <SPAN class="c1">riemann</SPAN> for the name of the actual RLISP
      function to execute. It is conventional in REDTEN to name this function
      by appending a <SPAN class="c1">!*</SPAN> to the user-name (there are
      plenty of violations of this convention, however). Thus, the actual
      work of computing the Riemann tensor is done by the RLISP function
      <SPAN class="c1">riemann!*()</SPAN> (but see ยง<A href=
      "node67.html#rename">F.1</A> for a caveat).
    </LI>
    <LI>A function called in this way receives a single argument which is a
    list of all actual arguments given in the function call (note the
    arguments should not be quoted). This statement begins the actual
    definition of the function (or ``procedure'' in REDUCE terminology).</LI>
    <LI>Various local variables will be required, which should be declared
    here, otherwise they will become ``fluid'' when this function is
    compiled.</LI>
    <LI>
      <UL>
        <LI>The mycar() function is similar to the standard lisp car()
        function, except that it works with <SPAN class="c1">nil</SPAN> as
        well, i.e. <SPAN class="c1">mycar(nil)</SPAN> <IMG align="bottom"
        src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6450.png"> <SPAN class="c1">nil</SPAN> (in
        many lisps <SPAN class="c1">car ('nil)</SPAN> is an error because
        <SPAN class="c1">nil</SPAN> is an atom). The mycar() function (and
        its siblings) are used throughout the REDTEN code, even where their
        enhanced functionality is not required. Thus, <SPAN class=
        "c1">mycar(u)</SPAN> is the argument to <SPAN class=
        "c1">riemann()</SPAN>, or <SPAN class="c1">nil</SPAN> if none was
        given.</LI>
        <LI>The getnme() function is used to determine the name (and index)
        of a given object from a number of possible formats. The input can be
        just a name, as will be the case here, and either indexed or not; or
        the input can be an <SPAN class="c1">rdr</SPAN>-form, where the index
        may indicate shift operations and the offspring object will be
        created if it does not yet exist. The second argument is a
        dotted-pair the first element of which indicates whether the indexed
        object must already be indexed (i.e. the object is being used for a
        calculation), or can be non-indexed (i.e. it is the name to use when
        creating the output object). The second element of the pair indicates
        if a name is even required (i.e. there is a default available). In
        this example a name is not required, but if one is given it need not
        be indexed. The last argument to getnme() is simply the name of the
        calling function, for use in error messages.</LI>
        <LI>The return from getnme() is a list of two elements: the first is
        the object name, the second is its index. Thus, <SPAN class=
        "c1">tnsr</SPAN> is assigned the name the user typed (if any), and
        will get the value <SPAN class="c1">nil</SPAN> if no name was given.
        Any index is ignored. If an index was attached to the input name,
        that name is already indexed, and, if not protected, will be
        destroyed and remade.</LI>
      </UL>
    </LI>
    <LI>For the current metric the Riemann function stores the name of the
    object it creates on the metric under the key riemann (see line 14). Any
    future calls to riemann() will find and return this name without making
    new calculations <EM>if</EM> the user did not supply a name (see line 7).
    The current tensor metric (returned by getmetric() with an argument of 1)
    is checked for a riemann property, any value found is assigned to
    <SPAN class="c1">lex</SPAN>; <SPAN class="c1">nil</SPAN> is assigned if
    no property exists.</LI>
    <LI>If the user does not supply a name to use for the output object, and
    the value found at line 6 is that of an indexed object, that object is
    returned immediately (see line 17 for an explanation of the format of the
    return value). If the user did supply a name for the output object, then
    a new object will be created and the calculations performed, even if the
    same calculation has already been done.</LI>
    <LI>The actual name of the output object is determined from the following
    rules: If a name was supplied by the user, then that is the name of the
    new object (the generic Riemann name will also point to it, see
    generics()). If no name was supplied, then the default name (stored on
    riemann) is made into the object name by prepending the name of the
    current tensor metric and an <SPAN class="c1">_</SPAN> character. Thus,
    if the metric has the name <SPAN class="c1">g1</SPAN>, the default name
    of the Riemann tensor created for this metric is <SPAN class=
    "c1">g1_R</SPAN>.
      <P>newnme() requires two arguments: the user-input name (which may be
      <SPAN class="c1">nil</SPAN>), and the default name (stored in this case
      on riemann, note there is no quote before <SPAN class=
      "c1">riemann</SPAN>: its value is passed to the function). newnme()
      also prints the <SPAN class="c1">Computing ...</SPAN> message to
      indicate to the user what the real name of the object will be. The
      generic name for the Riemann tensor will point to this object.</P>
    </LI>
    <LI>With the name of the output object stored in <SPAN class=
    "c1">tnsr</SPAN> the internal function to create indexed object is called
    (still named mktnsr!*() although it can create any kind of indexed
    object). Its arguments are nearly as described in ยง<A href=
    "node11.html#secmkobj">2.2</A>, but the symmetry lists are entered in
    internal format where the block size is placed in a sublist in each
    independent symmetry. The object has four covariant tensor indices, a
    Riemann symmetry, is not implicit, the itype is <SPAN class=
    "c1">riemann</SPAN>, and the description string is set to something
    informative.
      <P>mkmsg() takes one list, the first is a string containing
      <SPAN class="c1">%</SPAN> symbols. These are replaced in sequence by
      the remaining elements of the list. To print an indexed object wrap its
      <SPAN class="c1">rdr</SPAN>-form with the rdr!-string() function; to
      print a list as an index wrap it with index!-string(); <SPAN class=
      "c1"><CODE>\</CODE>%</SPAN> produces a literal <SPAN class=
      "c1">%</SPAN>.</P>
    </LI>
    <LI>The printname of the object is changed so that no matter what its
    real name is it is <EM>displayed</EM> in the same fashion (by default
    using the name <SPAN class="c1">R</SPAN> in this example).</LI>
    <LI>Equation <A href="node59.html#Riem">A.1</A> is now used to generate
    an indexed expression that will compute the Riemann tensor. This is
    written in an internal REDUCE format called ``prefix-form''. The result
    is assigned to <SPAN class="c1">lex</SPAN> for use in line 12 (this
    assignment could have been by-passed, writing the expression directly
    into line 12, but the code would be harder to read).
      <P>The prefix form involves lisp lists whose first element is an
      algebraic function, which will be applied to the remaining arguments.
      The following functions may be useful in constructing an indexed
      expression:</P>
      <P><IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tabular2574.png"></P>
      <P>There are two ways to construct a list in lisp: using the quote
      function (the input shorthand is <SPAN class="c1">'</SPAN>) which
      <EM>does not</EM> evaluate its arguments, and using the function list()
      which <EM>does</EM> evaluate its arguments. If a list is to be written
      whose contents may vary between one evaluation and the next, the list()
      function must be used. Generally, only numbers will be constant as such
      (for example, <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6452.png">
      can be constructed as <SPAN class="c1">'(quotient 1 2)</SPAN>); even if
      the name of an indexed object is assumed to be known it is better to
      make use of a variable which holds the name, so that the name can
      easily be changed later without affecting the code. Hence, writing
      indexed expressions requires many calls to list(). Notice that the
      arguments to list() must themselves be quoted if they are to be used
      literally. If any sublist is constructed using the list() function, all
      enclosing lists must be constructed the same way (not using the quote
      function), or the sublists will not be evaluated.</P>
      <P>Consider the code fragment</P>
      <P><SPAN class="c1">list ('rdr, mycar (christoffel1!* ('nil)), '(b!#
      d!# a!# !*br c!#))</SPAN></P>
      <P>which creates an <SPAN class="c1">rdr</SPAN>-form representing the
      first term of equation <A href="node59.html#Riem">A.1</A>. The name to
      be used for the indexed object is found by calling the christoffel1!*()
      function, which works in the same way as the riemann!*() function
      considered here. That is, christoffel1!*() either returns the name of
      the previously computed object, or does the computation now. In either
      case the return value is of the form described under line 17, so that
      mycar() is used to isolate the name. This method of having one function
      call others that it depends on allows the user to create all the
      objects of interest from the metric with one command (but see ยง<A href=
      "node42.html#secexpmanage">5.1</A> for reasons why this is not usually
      a good idea).</P>
      <P>The index can of course be written with specific indices and is thus
      constructed using the quote function. The actual indices are selected
      from those stored in the variable alphalist!* (which is simply a list
      of indices that the user will not use, since algebraic values assigned
      to these symbols could potentially have side-effects). The index is
      written with the internal forms of the index operators as shown in
      table <A href="node59.html#tabintop">A.1</A>; in the example above an
      ordinary differentiation operator has been placed in the index.</P>
      <P>Shift operations are indicated by making the index-element into a
      sublist with the operator as the first element. For example, an index
      might be written <SPAN class="c1">'(a!# (!*at!* b!#))</SPAN> to
      indicate shifting the second index-element. If the exact <SPAN class=
      "c1">indextype</SPAN> of an available object is unknown, the absolute
      shift operators can be used to ensure a canonical form is used in the
      expression. This technique is used in the frame package where it is not
      certain in advance whether the user has defined a covariant or
      contravariant connection.</P>
      <P>Examination of the rest of line 11 will show the correspondence with
      the terms of equation <A href="node59.html#Riem">A.1</A>. The repeated
      index <SPAN class="c1">e!#</SPAN> represents a contraction in the two
      products; and note the use of the unary minus to negate the last
      term.</P>
    </LI>
    <LI>The indexed expression in prefix-form is now passwd to the evaluator
    evaltnsr1(). This function is called almost directly when the user makes
    an indexed assignment with <SPAN class="c1">==</SPAN>, and receives the
    name and index of the object on the left-hand side, and the indexed
    expression on the right-hand side. A fourth argument is no longer used.
    It is in this function that the two levels of REDTEN alluded to above
    meet: the riemann!*() function as examined so far exists simply to
    automate the construction of an expression the user could have typed in
    by hand.
      <P>When evaltnsr1() finsishes, the output object (whose name is the
      value of <SPAN class="c1">tnsr</SPAN>) will have the appropriate
      values. If showindices is on, then the indices will be displayed as the
      calculation proceeds.</P>
    </LI>
    <LI>It is usual to apply a write-protection to the output object to
    prevent the user from accidentally changing components. If modification
    is desired, then the user can clear the protection with protect().</LI>
    <LI>The name of the output object is then placed on the property list of
    the current tensor metric under the key <SPAN class="c1">riemann</SPAN>.
    This is checked in line 6 to see if the object has previously been
    computed for this metric. This property is also used by the generic
    object system.</LI>
    <LI>Lines 15 do a special check; other functions may have similar checks
    or none at all.
      <OL>
        <LI>The components of the object are stored on the tvalue property.
        If there is no value here, then the object has no explicit
        components, i.e. it is 0. The body of the if statement is enclosed by
        the <SPAN class="c1">&lt;&lt;</SPAN> and <SPAN class=
        "c1">&gt;&gt;</SPAN> symbols.</LI>
        <LI>In this case an informative message is printed. The
        tabthenprint() function keeps track of the indenting of messages
        delivered during calculations.</LI>
        <LI>terpri() simply terminates a line, moving the cursor to the
        beginning of the next.</LI>
      </OL>
    </LI>
    <LI>A call to cleaner() prints the <SPAN class="c1">... finished</SPAN>
    messages for functions that have been called upon to perform work (but
    not directly by the user), and it cleans up temporary objects if this
    function was called directly by the user. Its single argument is the
    user-name of the function in which it is used.</LI>
    <LI>Finally, the name of the object is returned. To return a single name
    to the algebraic simplifier it should be in the form of a dotted-pair
    whose first element is the name, and whose second element is 1. Any
    function which calls this one must use <SPAN class="c1">car()</SPAN> to
    isolate the actual object name in the return value.</LI>
    <LI>The function definition ends here.</LI>
    <LI>To interface with the generic name system, a psuedo-object is created
    by makegeneric() which has many of the properties of the actual object.
    The first argument to makegeneric() is the name of the generic object, in
    this case the value of riemann (<SPAN class="c1">R</SPAN>). Recall that
    the name of the actual object is of the form <SPAN class=
    "c1">g1_R</SPAN>. The second argument specifies on which metric the
    relation between the generic and actual object will be stored (type 1 in
    this example, i.e. the tensor metric), and under what property to look
    for the relation. In this case, when the generic object <SPAN class=
    "c1">R</SPAN> is used, the system will examine the tensor metric for the
    riemann property, and use the object so specified (this is the same
    property used by the riemann!* function itself). The third and fourth
    arguments gives the <SPAN class="c1">indextype</SPAN> and symmetries of
    the generic object; the last argument gives the name of the lisp function
    that can be used to compute the actual object.</LI>
