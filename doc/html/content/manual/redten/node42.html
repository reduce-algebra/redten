  <P>Although General Relativity and most tensor analysis requires only that
  algebra be performed and derivatives taken (both of which are easily
  implemented on a computer), it is still necessary for the user to aid the
  machine in finding a workable path to the desired goal. The brute force
  approach (i.e. start it up and let it take a whack at the problem) will
  usually not succeed except for very simple problems or on very fast
  machines with lots of memory. Despite its high-sounding name, computer
  algebra remains as much an art as it is a science. Hence, although it is
  possible for the user to, with a single command, compute all the objects in
  a direct line from the metric to the Weyl tensor, unless the metric is very
  simple the calculation is not likely to succeed. The user must take a hand
  in simplifying the intermediate results before the more complicated objects
  are computed, otherwise the calculation will either take an inordinate
  amount of time, or, in the worst case, run out of memory. The techniques
  for managing large expressions are general ones and apply to REDUCE as much
  as to REDTEN; here we shall point out some particular points to observe
  that relate specifically to the sorts of problems encountered by the REDTEN
  user.</P>
  <P>The term ``management'' is chosen to reflect the process whereby the
  user interacts with the system to maintain expressions in a compact and
  reasonably simple form, and to avoid what is commonly referred to as
  ``intermediate expression swell''. Without attention it is quite possible
  that the components of some objects such as the Riemann or Ricci tensors
  could become so large as to jeopardize the calculation, even though the
  final answer is relatively simple (eg. the Weyl tensor is zero).</P>
  <P>The most common culprit which results in unweildly expressions is
  unsimplified denominators, specifically those which involve sums, and which
  must be expanded over the numerators of other terms when the system makes
  common denominators. One way to avoid this is to turn off the REDUCE switch
  mcd, but this usually just postpones the difficulties, since no real
  simplification and cancellations likely have occured and a large expression
  involving many terms must later be placed in common denominator form if it
  is to be finally simplified.</P>
  <P>In this regard, metrics come in two varieties: those which are diagonal
  and hence are trivial to invert; and those which are not diagonal, and
  generally yield a complicated denominator upon inversion. It is most
  important that the user address this issue before proceeding to the
  computation of the Christoffel symbols, and the christoffel1() function
  will print a warning message if the metric inverse seems not have not been
  simplified (This only means that the multiplier property must be combined
  with the components, as is done by mapfi() (qv)).</P>
  <P>A method that is sometimes useful in dealing with sums in denominators
  is substituting another symbol so that the sum is reduced to a simple
  product. However, this can yield explosive expressions elsewhere and,
  additionally, the user must remember to declare the dependencies of the new
  symbols, or to define their derivatives explicitly. Needless to say, if
  these are forgotten, the calculations may proceed quite smoothly but they
  no longer represent the intended metric. The decision of whether and when
  (and what) to substitute for various terms or when to introduce new ones is
  one of the only controls the user has over how the calculation proceeds.
  The user may also turn on or off the various REDUCE switches that control
  the way in which REDUCE combines expressions; of these exp, factor, gcd,
  and mcd are the most useful. However, as noted above these may often simply
  postpone the difficulties, since at some point the expression must be
  expanded for it to be simplified.</P>
  <P>An example involving the Kerr metric (a metric much-maligned for
  <A name="1482" id="1482"></A> being complicated, when in fact it is still
  relatively simple) is used to illustrate some principles of expression
  management in REDTEN. The Kerr metric is well known in General Relativity
  and is identified with the vacuum solution of the Einstein Field Equations
  outside a spinning mass. In Boyer-Lindquist coordinates (<IMG align=
  "bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6286.png">, <IMG align="bottom" src=
  "_10787_tex2html_wrap6288.png">, <IMG align="bottom" src=
  "_10787_tex2html_wrap6290.png">, <IMG align="bottom" src=
  "_10787_tex2html_wrap6292.png">) the line-element has the form:</P>
  <P><IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_displaymath6280.png"></P>
  <P>where</P>
  <DL>
    <DD><IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6294.png">,</DD>

    <DD>and <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6412.png"> is the
    geometrized mass of the object.</DD>
  </DL>
  <P>In terms of a metric tensor, the Kerr metric is written as</P>
  <P><IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_displaymath6281.png"></P>
  <P>We shall enter this metric in line-element form and create the
  metric:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>coords '(t r th ph)$</I>

#: <I>ds2 := - delta/rho2*(d(t)-a*sin(th)^2*d(ph))^2
   + sin(th)^2/rho2*((r^2+a^2)*d(ph)-a * d(t))^2
   + rho2/delta * d(r)^2+rho2*d(th)^2$</I>

#: <I>metric(ds2);</I>

computing g2
cofactor finished.
determ finished.
invert finished.

 g2

</SPAN></PRE>We first observe that there are more messages during the
computation of this metric, since it takes more work to invert it. At this
point the metric inverse can be simplified in several ways. When the system
inverts a non-diagonal metric, the reciprocal of the determinant of the
metric is placed as a multiplicative factor on the multiplier property of the
inverse. This can be examined (and altered) with the function
multiplier()<A name="tex2html90" href="footnode.html#4142" id=
"tex2html90"><IMG align="bottom" alt=".png&quot;" src=
"../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A>:
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>multiplier(g_inv); % note we use the generic name</I>

                2         4  4            2  4            2  2  2
 ( - 1)/(sin(th)  (sin(th)  a  - 2 sin(th)  a  - 2 sin(th)  a  r

                4      2  2    4
             + a  + 2 a  r  + r ))

</SPAN></PRE>If there is a second argument to multiplier(), the multiplier of
the object is replaced by that value. Hence, the user can first save the
multiplier, and then replace it with some other expression that presumably
will help the calculation proceed. One could also examine the multiplier for
a sub-expression that could be replaced by a symbol, as mentioned above.
  <P>For the Kerr metric, another approach has proven to work well. It will
  be observed that substitutions for <IMG align="bottom" src=
  "_10787_tex2html_wrap6306.png"> and <IMG align="bottom" src=
  "_10787_tex2html_wrap6304.png"> (<SPAN class="c1">rho2</SPAN> and
  <SPAN class="c1">delta</SPAN>) have not yet been made. One can invert the
  relation for <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6306.png"> and
  solve for <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6312.png"> to yield
  the substitution</P>
  <P><IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_displaymath6282.png"></P>
  <P>which is best entered as a REDUCE <SPAN class="c1">let</SPAN>
  rule<A name="tex2html91" href="footnode.html#4502" id=
  "tex2html91"><IMG align="bottom" alt=".png&quot;" src=
  "../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A>:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>let r^2=a^2*sin(th)^2-a^2+rho2;</I>
</SPAN></PRE>Whenever <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6312.png">
   is formed during the calculations that will follow it will immediately be
  replaced by this substitution. However, the metric and its inverse still
  need to have this rule applied. First we shall show that in fact this
  substitution does provide a useful simplification by re-evaluating the
  multiplier of the metric inverse:
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>multiplier(g_inv);</I>
<BR>
        - 1
 ----------------
         2     2
  sin(th)  rho2

</SPAN></PRE>Obviously this expression is much more compact than the previous
one, and is no longer a sum. Note however, that the actual value of the
multiplier property is as yet unchanged. Also recall that new <SPAN class=
"c1">let</SPAN> rules and assignments can be evaluated in a given expression
by applying the REDUCE functions sub() or reval() to the expression.
