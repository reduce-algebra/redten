  <P><A name="secgenerics" id="secgenerics"></A> <A name="1323" id=
  "1323"></A> As noted above, each GR function creates an object with a name
  of the form <SPAN class="c1">&lt;metric&gt;_&lt;name&gt;</SPAN>, so that
  any number of metrics and their families may exist in the system
  simultaneously. Each object has a unique name, and each function returns
  the object appropriate for the metric currently in use. However, these
  names are not particularly convenient for general usage such as building
  indexed expressions. Thus, a set of ``generic'' names has been created that
  allow the user to easily access the objects in the family of the current
  metric.</P>
  <P>A generic name is a psuedo-indexed object: it has some properties of
  indexed objects that allow it to be parsed with an index, but it never has
  explicit or implicit values, and it has some extra properties that mark it
  as generic. Specifically, the generic property of a generic name contains
  the type of metric to look at, and the name of the property key on that
  metric to examine. That key is the name of the function that created the
  actual object of interest, and is the place where that function stored the
  name of its output. For example, the generic name R has a generic property
  that refers to the tensor metric and the key riemann, which is where the
  function riemann() stores the name of its output.</P>
  <P>The system, when it encounters a generic name, immediately examines the
  generic property to locate the target object. If the metric is changed, the
  system will look at the new metric and the generic name will refer to some
  other object. Thus, the same generic name is used for the same class of
  object for many different metrics. If the target object does not exist and
  the generic reference is not part of an indexed assignment, it will return
  unevaluated and will do so until the object is made, or the metric is
  changed to one for which the desired object has been created. The user can
  therefore set up expressions involving generic objects, assign them to
  REDUCE algebraic variables before any metrics are created, and then use
  them after some metrics are made to evaluate the same expression for each
  metric. For example,</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class=
"c1">#: <I>kr := R[a,b,c,d]*R[@a,@b,@c,@d];   % R has no target yet</I>

         a b c d
  kr := R        R
                  a b c d

#: <I>% create some metrics and compute their Riemann tensors ...</I>

#: <I>setmetric(g1)$</I>

#: <I>seval(kr);</I>

  &lt;output&gt;

#: <I>setmetric(g2)$</I>

#: <I>seval(kr);</I>

  &lt;output&gt; 
</SPAN></PRE>will evaluate the Kretschmann scalar for the metrics
  <SPAN class="c1">g1</SPAN> and <SPAN class="c1">g2</SPAN>. Of course, if
  the output of the expression was also indexed, then a new object would have
  to be created each time the expression was evaluated.
  <P>If, when an expression containing unresolved generic references is
  included in an indexed assignment (such as the call to seval() above), and
  the target objects have not yet been created, they will be automatically
  computed since each generic object also carries information on how to make
  its target. However, it is generally better if the user calls the
  generating functions directly, since the target objects can be simpified
  and examined before being involved in a potentially expensive computation
  (see ยง<A href="node42.html#secexpmanage">5.1</A> for more information).</P>
  <P>There are a large number of generic names pre-defined in REDTEN; for the
  GR package the commonly used ones are g for the metric, c1 and c2 for the
  Christoffel symbols, R for the Riemann tensor, ric and ricsc for the Ricci
  tensor and scalar respectively, C for the Weyl tensor and G for the
  Einstein tensor. More than one generic name can point to the same target,
  thus ri also refers to the Riemann tensor, and ei refers to the Einstein
  tensor. The function generics() will show the user what generic names
  exist, and whether there is a target object present.</P>
  <P>The only generic names actually created in REDTEN are those whose
  targets are a parent object. Shifted objects and any other objects whose
  names include a <SPAN class="c1">_</SPAN> symbol (eg. covariant
  derivatives) are handled by examining the fragments of their names. If the
  portion of the name before the <SPAN class="c1">_</SPAN> symbol is a
  generic name, the target name replaces the initial portion of the name.
  Hence, if the current-metric is <SPAN class="c1">g1</SPAN> and the target
  of R is <SPAN class="c1">g1_R</SPAN> then the target of <SPAN class=
  "c1">R_b</SPAN> is <SPAN class="c1">g1_R_b</SPAN>. All functions that take
  an indexed object as input will accept a generic name (actually, the name
  is resolved before the function gets it), and the output of these functions
  will involve the target name.</P>
