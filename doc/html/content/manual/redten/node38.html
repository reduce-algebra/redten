As noted above, each GR function creates an object with a name of the
form <tt>&lt;metric&gt;_&lt;name&gt;</tt>, so that any number of metrics
and their families may exist in the system simultaneously. Each object
has a unique name, and each function returns the object appropriate
for the metric currently in use. However, these names are not
particularly convenient for general usage such as building indexed
expressions. Thus, a set of ``generic'' names has been created that
allow the user to easily access the objects in the family of the
current metric.
<P>
A generic name is a psuedo-indexed object: it has some properties of
indexed objects that allow it to be parsed with an index, but it never
has explicit or implicit values, and it has some extra properties that
mark it as generic. Specifically, the generic property of a
generic name contains the type of metric to look at, and the name of
the property key on that metric to examine. That key is the name of
the function that created the actual object of interest, and is the
place where that function stored the name of its output. For example,
the generic name R has a generic property that refers to
the tensor metric and the key riemann, which is where the
function riemann() stores the name of its output.
<P>
The system, when it encounters a generic name, immediately examines
the generic property to locate the target object. If the metric
is changed, the system will look at the new metric and the generic
name will refer to some other object. Thus, the same generic name is
used for the same class of object for many different metrics. If the
target object does not exist and the generic reference is not part of
an indexed assignment, it will return unevaluated and will do so until
the object is made, or the metric is changed to one for which the
desired object has been created. The user can therefore set up
expressions involving generic objects, assign them to REDUCE
algebraic variables before any metrics are created, and then use them
after some metrics are made to evaluate the same expression for each
metric. For example,
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>kr := R[a,b,c,d]*R[@a,@b,@c,@d];   % R has no target yet</i>

         a b c d
  kr := R        R
                  a b c d

#: <i>% create some metrics and compute their Riemann tensors ...</i>

#: <i>setmetric(g1)$</i>

#: <i>seval(kr);</i>

  &lt;output&gt;

#: <i>setmetric(g2)$</i>

#: <i>seval(kr);</i>

  &lt;output&gt; 
</tt></PRE>will evaluate the Kretschmann scalar for the metrics <tt>g1</tt> and <tt>g2</tt>. Of course, if the output of the expression was also indexed, then
a new object would have to be created each time the expression was
evaluated.
<P>
If, when an expression containing unresolved generic references is
included in an indexed assignment (such as the call to seval()
above), and the target objects have not yet been created, they will be
automatically computed since each generic object also carries
information on how to make its target. However, it is generally better
if the user calls the generating functions directly, since the target
objects can be simpified and examined before being involved in a
potentially expensive computation (see &#167;<A HREF="node42.html#secexpmanage">5.1</A> for more
information).
<P>
There are a large number of generic names pre-defined in REDTEN;
for the GR package the commonly used ones are g for the metric,
c1 and c2 for the Christoffel symbols, R for the
Riemann tensor, ric and ricsc for the Ricci tensor and
scalar respectively, C for the Weyl tensor and G for the
Einstein tensor. More than one generic name can point to the same
target, thus ri also refers to the Riemann tensor, and ei
refers to the Einstein tensor.  The function generics() will
show the user what generic names exist, and whether there is a target
object present.
<P>
The only generic names actually created in REDTEN are those whose
targets are a parent object. Shifted objects and any other objects
whose names include a <tt>_</tt> symbol (eg. covariant derivatives) are
handled by examining the fragments of their names. If the portion of
the name before the <tt>_</tt> symbol is a generic name, the target name
replaces the initial portion of the name. Hence, if the current-metric
is <tt>g1</tt> and the target of R is <tt>g1_R</tt> then the target
of <tt>R_b</tt> is <tt>g1_R_b</tt>. All functions that take an indexed
object as input will accept a generic name (actually, the name is
resolved before the function gets it), and the output of these
functions will involve the target name.
