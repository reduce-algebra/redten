  <P><A name="ssecmapfi" id="ssecmapfi"></A> mapfi() To re-evaluate each of
  the components of the metric and its inverse and actually change the stored
  components the function mapfi()<A name="tex2html92" href=
  "footnode.html#1563" id="tex2html92"><IMG align="bottom" alt=".png&quot;"
  src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A> is used. In its simplest
  form, mapfi() takes an indexed object name and re-evaluates in-place each
  component of the object. We can apply the new <SPAN class="c1">let</SPAN>
  rule to the metric and its inverse by</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>mapfi(g);</I>

 g2

#: <I>mapfi(g_inv);</I>

 g2_inv
</SPAN></PRE>If the switch showindices is on, the index of each component is
displayed during the computation. A side effect of mapfi() is that the
multiplier of an object is combined with each of its components, and the
multiplier property is reset to 1. The old values of the object are saved,
and can be recovered if the user immediately executes the restoreobj()
command. Only one object is saved by the system at a time, hence the need to
immediately recover. If in doubt, the user can also make a backup by copying
the object with the icopy() function (see below).
  <P>The mapfi() function is not limited to such simple things as
  re-evaluating an indexed object in a new environment, it can also be used
  to apply specific functions to specific portions of the object. The most
  general format of the call to mapfi() is</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">  mapfi(function(name{index},{args}));
</SPAN></PRE>where <SPAN class="c1">&lt;function&gt;</SPAN> is some function
that operates on algebraic expressions. The indexed object can either be just
a name (so that the function is applied to the whole object) or an index that
isolates part of the object, or even a fixed index, so that a single element
is affected. mapfi() works by inserting each component of the indexed object
into the input expression and evaluating it. The input can in fact be any
expression but is most often a sub() command or occasionally a Taylor series
function such as ps().
  <P>For example, if the user entered a general static spherically symmetric
  metric, and then wanted to substitute <IMG align="bottom" src=
  "_10787_tex2html_wrap6314.png">, it could be done in two ways. First, an
  actual assignment to the variable <SPAN class="c1">f</SPAN> could be made,
  followed by an application of mapfi() similar to that demonstrated above.
  However, other objects involving <SPAN class="c1">f</SPAN> would also be
  affected if they were involved in indexed assignments, or if mapfi() were
  applied. To make the substitution into only a single object can be done as
  follows:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class=
"c1">#: <I>mapfi(sub(f=1-2*m/r,g3));  % g3 is a metric defined in terms of f</I>

   g3
</SPAN></PRE>If it were necessary to use a series approximation to the metric
coefficients about <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6316.png">,
this could be done via
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>mapfi(ps(g3,r,2*m));</I>

   g3
</SPAN></PRE>
  <P>Continuing with the Kerr metric example, we can define the derivatives
  of the as yet unevaluated symbols <SPAN class="c1">rho2</SPAN> and
  <SPAN class="c1">delta</SPAN>, and compute the Ricci tensor:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>depend delta,r;</I>

#: <I>depend rho2,r,th;</I>

#: <I>let df(rho2,r) = 2*r;</I>

#: <I>let df(delta,r) = 2*r-2*m;</I>

#: <I>let df(rho2,th) = -2*a^2*sin(th)*cos(th);</I>

#: <I>ricci();</I>

computing g2_ric
  computing g2_R
    computing g2_c1
    christoffel1 finished. 
    computing g2_c2
    christoffel2 finished.
  riemann finished.

 g2_ric
</SPAN></PRE>At this point in the calculation, the Ricci tensor
  <SPAN class="c1">g2_ric</SPAN> will still appear to have non-zero
  components, since <SPAN class="c1">rho2</SPAN> and <SPAN class=
  "c1">delta</SPAN> remain unevaluated. For other metrics it may be found
  that it is better to not evaluate the derivatives, or it may be best to
  fully evaluate everything from the start. It is a matter of trying
  different possibilities to determine which allows the successful completion
  of the calculation. If certain terms remain unevaluated, then sooner or
  later they must be given their actual values; the issue is when to do this
  so as to balance the growth of expressions. Evaluating too soon may mean
  the expressions swell (especially if a sum in a denominator is formed in
  the metric inverse), whereas delayed evaluation may mean that many
  cancellations have not occurred, and a large amount of work must now be
  done to insert the terms. For another example of this sort of work, see the
  Sato metric in Appendix <A href="node60.html#appsato">B</A>. <A name="1607"
  id="1607"></A>
  <P>It is in all cases, however, best to avoid the occurrence of radicals
  such as would be formed if the substitution in the Kerr metric were for
  <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6432.png"> rather than
  <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6306.png">. Many algebraic
  systems seem to have difficulties where radicals are concerned, and since
  the computation of the higher order tensors involves differentiation more
  radicals will be formed. It is almost always best to make a substitution
  for the radical since its derivatives can be defined in terms of itself,
  and this often reduces the complexity of expressions.</P>
  <P>The final simplication of the Ricci tensor for the Kerr metric can be
  done with a single mapfi() command:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>clear r^2;</I>

#: <I>mapfi(sub(delta = r^2+a^2-2*m*r,rho2=r^2+a^2*cos(th)^2,ric));</I>

 g2_ric
</SPAN></PRE>Note that is was necessary to clear the substitution rule for
<SPAN class="c1">r^2</SPAN>, since otherwise this would result in a circular
evaluation for <SPAN class="c1">rho2</SPAN>. A package for managing the
various let rules and assignments in the system is described in ยง<A href=
"node54.html#secredenv">7.1</A>.
  <P>It may be observed that attempting to evaluate the Ricci tensor for this
  metric when <SPAN class="c1">delta</SPAN> and <SPAN class="c1">rho2</SPAN>
  are given their actual values at the outset results in a <SPAN class=
  "c1">Heap space exhausted</SPAN> fatal error on some systems. The value of
  carefully controlling evaluations is therefore apparent. It is useful to
  turn on the showindices switch when working with an unfamiliar metric,
  because a judgement can then be made as to whether the calculations are
  proceeding at an acceptable rate, and whether a different approach might be
  more profitable. The switch peek when on acts like showindices, but causes
  the system to indicate whether a component has evaluated to zero or not.
  The user can then immediately see if the calculation is proceeding
  correctly (assuming, as is often the case, that zero is the expected
  answer).</P>
