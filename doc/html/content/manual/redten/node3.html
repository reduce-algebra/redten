      <a name="sechist" id="sechist"></a> The beginnings of REDTEN go back to
      1983, when a summer project was begun with the goal of implementing a
      tensor algebra system in MAPLE<a

      >. After many difficulties this project was abandoned, but was later taken
      up again for a Masters thesis, this time using muMATH<a
        name="tex2html2"
        href="footnode.html#94"
        id="tex2html2"
        ><img

      /></a>
      as the base system.
    </p>
    <p>
      muMATH was a small, relatively simple computer algebra system, running on
      IBM PC's and related INTEL-88 machines. As a LISP-based system, and with
      source code available for all but the kernel functions, it was
      particularly easy to introduce new data structures and functions, and,
      where necessary, re-define existing ones. Thus, in a relatively short time
      a basic working tensor system was produced. After a somewhat longer period
      a more advanced and capable system was available, with essentially all of
      the major features of REDTEN today.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the outset, it was clear that a new system should implement tensor
      algebra, and not just a few operations with tensors. It was intended that
      the user be able to enter expressions and see results as close to the
      conventional form as was possible with a normal terminal screen and
      keyboard. Rather than calling a function to add two tensors, for example,
      the user would simply type the names and associated indices, and assign
      the result to a new tensor. If the sum involved three objects, the user
      would just add the third name; in other systems it might be necessary to
      break this operation into two parts, involving two sums and one
      intermediate object. It was this ``serial construction'' that was
      particularly to be avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      To accomplish this goal generally requires modifying the system parser to
      accept new operators. In muMATH this possibility is designed into the
      parser, and is therefore extremely simple. With a new assignment operator
      (in muTENSOR it was ``::'', in REDTEN it is ``=='') a new function is
      installed to handle the input: it receives the left and right hand sides
      of the assignment. Since the data structure representing algebraic
      expressions is known, it is a straightforward matter for the new system
      function to treat the expression as a tensor expression, and to produce
      the desired result.
    </p>
    <p>
      As muTENSOR advanced, the amount of code involved soon exceeded that in
      the basic muMATH kernel. Since muMATH was capable of using only 256
      Kilobytes of memory (even on machines with larger amounts of memory), the
      amount of working space (where algebraic calculations are carried out and
      results stored) gradually decreased. Eventually, there was almost no room
      left to introduce new functions, and large calculations could not be
      performed due to the space required to hold all the intermediate results
      in core. This prompted the development of a ``virtual memory'' sub-system,
      which allowed the storage of the components of a tensor in secondary
      storage, such as a hard-disk or ram-disk. A needed component was read in
      from the disk, used, discarded and the results of the computation possibly
      written to disk, all automatically; generally the time required to
      retrieve the component was much less than the time required to do algebra
      with it, so that the overhead was negligible. This allowed much larger
      problems to be successfully tackled, such as showing that the Kerr metric
      is vacuum, which required about 20 minutes on an IBM AT.
    </p>
    <p>
      muTENSOR was demonstrated or described at several General Relativity
      conferences, and as a result, a moderately large group of users developed
      in several countries. However, the small amount of working space, even
      with the virtual memory sub-system, and the very simple algorithms used to
      implement algebra in muMATH<a
        name="tex2html3"
        href="footnode.html#105"
        id="tex2html3"
        ><img
          align="bottom"
          alt='.png"'
          src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"
      /></a>
      made it increasingly obvious that a larger more capable base system was
      needed if further advancement was to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      In late 1985 it was determined that REDUCEhttp://??? would provide the
      power needed for an improved version of muTENSOR, to be called REDTEN.
      Since REDUCE is also LISP-based, the transportation of the code to the
      REDUCE environment was relatively simple, the major difficulties being in
      the interaction with the I/O system and the internal data structure of
      expressions, which although similar in concept to those of muMATH,
      differed in detail. Otherwise, most of the code was simply translated
      directly from muSIMP (the base lisp of muMATH) to RLISP (the extended
      syntax of Standard Lisp) in which REDUCE is written. To this day there is
      code in REDTEN with an odd ``flavour'' due to the original influence of
      muSIMP.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the two systems evolved in parallel, each receiving the same
      upgrades and bug fixes as the other. In REDTEN a virtual memory system was
      unnecessary<a name="tex2html4" href="footnode.html#4086" id="tex2html4"
        ><img
          align="bottom"
          alt='.png"'
          src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png" /></a
      >, while at the same time more code could be developed to expand the
      system. Thus, REDTEN gradually became more advanced, with several new
      features not available in muTENSOR (such as frame and spinor packages). It
      was found the the REDTEN system was very capable and met all expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attempt was again made to implement a tensor-algebra system in MAPLE,
      using muTENSOR as a model. This system, called MapleTensor<a
        name="tex2html5"
        href="footnode.html#127"
        id="tex2html5"
        ><img
          align="bottom"
          alt='.png"'
          src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png" /></a
      >, was partially successful, but met difficulties with interacting with
      the MAPLE I/O system and with accessing the internal data structures used
      for expressions. It therefore lacked the same ``feel'' as muTENSOR and
      REDTEN and was not as convenient to use; support for MapleTensor has since
      been dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1988(??) muMATH was discontinued, and a new product, DERIVE, was
      introduced by the Soft Warehouse. Unfortunately, DERIVE, as a much simpler
      system, does not include a programming environment. Hence, muTENSOR became
      an orphaned system, and its development has halted, while that of REDTEN
      has continued. Although a successor to muMATH may become available in the
      future, many of todays personal computers are capable of running REDUCE
      (and therefore REDTEN), so that the need for a small compact system is
      less of an issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently REDTEN is at version v4.0, and is continuing to evolve. Many
      improvements have been made in the past few years, and the kernel of the
      system has reached a relatively stable configuration. Recent improvements
      also include support for REDUCE 3.5 (the current version of REDUCE) and a
      basic clean-up of the code. It is hoped that REDTEN will soon become a
      part of the REDUCE network-library of contributed programs, and therefore
      more widely available.
