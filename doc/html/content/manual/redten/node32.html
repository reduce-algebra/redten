</SPAN></PRE>create and display the ``mixed'' Einstein tensor for the RW
metric, which has the form expected for a pressureless dust. The last command
shows a short form for accessing specific elements of a shifted object, the
full object name need not be typed, only the parent name with the proper
shift operation. If such a reference is made before the offspring is
computed, it will return unevaluated unless it was the argument to an
explicit shift() command.
  <P>The offspring object created by shift() has a name formed by appending
  to the parent name an underscore (<SPAN class="c1">_</SPAN>) and a
  lower-case letter (or letters) derived from the locations of the shifted
  indices. This name is reported in the <SPAN class="c1">computing
  &lt;name&gt;_&lt;letter&gt;</SPAN> message that is displayed when shift()
  is called either explicitly or implicitly. The new object is given the
  appropriate indextype entry, and the same coordinates, print-name and type
  as the parent. The symmetries are derived from the parent's, accounting for
  the shifting of the indices, more is said on this below. Both the parent
  and the offspring are write-protected, so that they cannot be inadvertently
  altered and render the relation inconsistent. The offspring object has the
  parent property set, and the description string indicates its origin. The
  shift property of the parent is updated to show the new object belonging to
  the parent's family.</P>
  <P>As the user may call shift() at any time, the environment of the system
  is changed to that of the parent before the operation proceeds. This is
  accomplished by looking at the altmetric property of the parent to find the
  tensor metric that existed at the time the parent was created. This is
  temporarily installed as the current-metric and the system coordinates are
  changed to match. After the offspring is created (having been given the
  correct altmetric and coords properties), they system environment is
  restored. If the user aborts the shift operation then the system
  environment can be reset by calling setmetric() with the name of the metric
  which should be the current metric. The altmetric property may be examined
  or changed with the altmetric() function.</P>
  <P>When shift() is called, it first determines the index structure of the
  offspring object and checks in the list of existing offspring (on the
  property shift of the parent) for a match. If the object exists shift
  returns quickly. Otherwise, shift() finds the closest offspring and forms
  the metric contractions with it, which presumably requires the least amount
  of work. As the parent object is always first in the shift list (after a
  flag which if <SPAN class="c1">nil</SPAN> indicates that shifting is
  allowed on this object), it may be that the parent will be used. If the
  user types the name of an offspring object and an index indicating a shift,
  the parent object is determined from the parent property, and then the
  shift relative to the parent is computed, allowing shift() to proceed as
  before.</P>
  <P>As noted above, the symmetries of the offspring are determined from
  those of the parent. Any independent symmetry of the parent which, in the
  offspring, relates indices that are all covariant or contravariant (but not
  mixed) is retained. Thus, if the first index of the Riemann tensor is
  raised, only the anti-symmetry in the third and fourth indices survives,
  but if all the indices are raised, the offspring has the full Riemann
  symmetry. To ensure the most efficient operation of the system, the parent
  object should always be the most symmetric of the entire family of related
  objects, since shift() cannot determine if any new symmetries will
  appear.</P>
  <P>Normally the application of the intrinsic symmetries of an object to
  canonicalize the index results in the indices being sorted into
  alphabetical order. If an index element is to be shifted, then it takes
  precedence when being sorted, so that indices shifting up are moved to the
  left, and indices shifting down are moved to the right. Thus, the canonical
  form of the shifted object takes priority over the canonical form of the
  index alone. For example,</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>hG[b,a];</I>

  hG
    a b

#: <I>hG[@b,a];</I>

  hG
      a
</SPAN></PRE>Certain objects are shifted by contracting with things other
than the metric; for these the user can change the altmetric property with
the altmetric() command. This function takes the name of the object whose
properties are being modified and the name of a rank-2 object that will be
the alternate metric. With only one argument, altmetric() shows what metrics
are defined for the given object.
  <P>The tensor metric itself has its indices raised to form the metric
  inverse via a matrix inverse computed by invert(); this function sets up
  the shift property on the metric, and also adds the proper delta function
  to represent a metric with mixed indices. The delta functions are created
  by the function delta(), but ordinarily this function need never be called
  by the user since the delta functions are created automatically for each
  kind of index in the system by defindextype(). The delta functions
  themselves form a family of three objects, one with both indices up, one
  with both down, and a mixed object. The names of the delta functions are by
  default of the form <SPAN class="c1">d&lt;n&gt;_c</SPAN>, <SPAN class=
  "c1">d&lt;n&gt;_d</SPAN> and <SPAN class="c1">d&lt;n&gt;</SPAN>,
  respectively, where <SPAN class="c1">&lt;n&gt;</SPAN> is the type of index
  the delta function is defined for. Unlike the usual naming convention for
  the delta functions, <SPAN class="c1">d&lt;n&gt;_c</SPAN> is the parent,
  because it has the symmetries, but the mixed object, being most commonly
  used, is given the simpler name <SPAN class="c1">d&lt;n&gt;</SPAN>; this is
  the delta function used for the mixed metric.<BR></P>
