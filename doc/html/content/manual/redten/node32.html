<A NAME=ssecshift>&#160;</A>	In order to perform a metric contraction that will raise or lower an
index, the user types the index with the <tt>@</tt> operator preceeding
the appropriate index element. The operation is performed when an
expression containing the object appears as the right hand side of an
indexed assignment. If the user wishes to form the shifted object
immediately, the function shift() can be applied to the object.

</tt></PRE>create and display the ``mixed'' Einstein tensor for the RW metric,
which has the form expected for a pressureless dust. The last command
shows a short form for accessing specific elements of a shifted
object, the full object name need not be typed, only the parent name
with the proper shift operation. If such a reference is made before
the offspring is computed, it will return unevaluated unless it was
the argument to an explicit shift() command.
<P>

<P>
The offspring object created by shift() has a name formed by
appending to the parent name an underscore (<tt>_</tt>) and a lower-case
letter (or letters) derived from the locations of the shifted indices.
This name is reported in the <tt>computing &lt;name&gt;_&lt;letter&gt;</tt> message
that is displayed when shift() is called either explicitly or
implicitly.  The new object is given the appropriate indextype
entry, and the same coordinates, print-name and type as the parent.
The symmetries are derived from the parent's, accounting for the
shifting of the indices, more is said on this below. Both the parent
and the offspring are write-protected, so that they cannot be
inadvertently altered and render the relation inconsistent. The
offspring object has the parent property set, and the
description string indicates its origin.  The shift property of
the parent is updated to show the new object belonging to the
parent's family.
<P>
As the user may call shift() at any time, the environment of the
system is changed to that of the parent before the operation proceeds.
This is accomplished by looking at the altmetric property of the
parent to find the tensor metric that existed at the time the parent
was created. This is temporarily installed as the current-metric and
the system coordinates are changed to match. After the offspring is
created (having been given the correct altmetric and
coords properties), they system environment is restored. If the user
aborts the shift operation then the system environment can be reset by
calling setmetric() with the name of the metric which should be
the current metric. The altmetric property may be
examined or changed with the altmetric() function.
<P>
When shift() is called, it first determines the index structure
of the offspring object and checks in the list of existing offspring
(on the property shift of the parent) for a match. If the object
exists shift returns quickly. Otherwise, shift() finds the closest
offspring and forms the metric contractions with it, which presumably
requires the least amount of work. As the parent object is always
first in the shift list (after a flag which if <tt>nil</tt>
indicates that shifting is allowed on this object), it may be that the
parent will be used. If the user types the name of an offspring object
and an index indicating a shift, the parent object is determined from
the parent property, and then the shift relative to the parent
is computed, allowing shift() to proceed as before.
<P>
As noted above, the symmetries of the offspring are determined from
those of the parent. Any independent symmetry of the parent which, in
the offspring, relates indices that are all covariant or contravariant
(but not mixed) is retained. Thus, if the first index of the Riemann
tensor is raised, only the anti-symmetry in the third and fourth
indices survives, but if all the indices are raised, the offspring has
the full Riemann symmetry. To ensure the most efficient operation of
the system, the parent object should always be the most symmetric of
the entire family of related objects, since shift() cannot
determine if any new symmetries will appear.
<P>
Normally the application of the intrinsic symmetries of an object to
canonicalize the index results in the indices being sorted into
alphabetical order. If an index element is to be shifted, then it
takes precedence when being sorted, so that indices shifting up are
moved to the left, and indices shifting down are moved to the right.
Thus, the canonical form of the shifted object takes priority over the
canonical form of the index alone. For example,
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>hG[b,a];</i>

  hG
    a b

#: <i>hG[@b,a];</i>

    b
  hG
      a
</tt></PRE>Certain objects are shifted by contracting with things other than the
metric; for these the user can change the altmetric property
with the altmetric() command. This function takes the name of
the object whose properties are being modified and the name of a
rank-2 object that will be the alternate metric. With only one
argument, altmetric() shows what metrics are defined for the given
object.
<P>
 The tensor metric itself has its indices raised to form the metric
inverse via a matrix inverse computed by invert(); this function
sets up the shift property on the metric, and also adds the
proper delta function to represent a metric with mixed indices. The
delta functions are created by the function delta(), but
ordinarily this function need never be called by the user since the
delta functions are created automatically for each kind of index in
the system by defindextype(). The delta functions themselves
form a family of three objects, one with both indices up, one with
both down, and a mixed object. The names of the delta functions are by
default of the form <tt>d&lt;n&gt;_c</tt>, <tt>d&lt;n&gt;_d</tt> and <tt>d&lt;n&gt;</tt>,
respectively, where <tt>&lt;n&gt;</tt> is the type of index the delta function
is defined for. Unlike the usual naming convention for the delta
functions, <tt>d&lt;n&gt;_c</tt> is the parent, because it has the symmetries,
but the mixed object, being most commonly used, is given the simpler
name <tt>d&lt;n&gt;</tt>; this is the delta function used for the mixed metric.
