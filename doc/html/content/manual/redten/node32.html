    create and display the ``mixed'' Einstein tensor for the RW metric, which
    has the form expected for a pressureless dust. The last command shows a
    short form for accessing specific elements of a shifted object, the full
    object name need not be typed, only the parent name with the proper shift
    operation. If such a reference is made before the offspring is computed, it
    will return unevaluated unless it was the argument to an explicit shift()
    command.
    <p>
      The offspring object created by shift() has a name formed by appending to
      the parent name an underscore (<span class="c1">_</span>) and a lower-case
      letter (or letters) derived from the locations of the shifted indices.
      This name is reported in the
      <span class="c1">computing &lt;name&gt;_&lt;letter&gt;</span> message that
      is displayed when shift() is called either explicitly or implicitly. The
      new object is given the appropriate indextype entry, and the same
      coordinates, print-name and type as the parent. The symmetries are derived
      from the parent's, accounting for the shifting of the indices, more is
      said on this below. Both the parent and the offspring are write-protected,
      so that they cannot be inadvertently altered and render the relation
      inconsistent. The offspring object has the parent property set, and the
      description string indicates its origin. The shift property of the parent
      is updated to show the new object belonging to the parent's family.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the user may call shift() at any time, the environment of the system is
      changed to that of the parent before the operation proceeds. This is
      accomplished by looking at the altmetric property of the parent to find
      the tensor metric that existed at the time the parent was created. This is
      temporarily installed as the current-metric and the system coordinates are
      changed to match. After the offspring is created (having been given the
      correct altmetric and coords properties), they system environment is
      restored. If the user aborts the shift operation then the system
      environment can be reset by calling setmetric() with the name of the
      metric which should be the current metric. The altmetric property may be
      examined or changed with the altmetric() function.
    </p>
    <p>
      When shift() is called, it first determines the index structure of the
      offspring object and checks in the list of existing offspring (on the
      property shift of the parent) for a match. If the object exists shift
      returns quickly. Otherwise, shift() finds the closest offspring and forms
      the metric contractions with it, which presumably requires the least
      amount of work. As the parent object is always first in the shift list
      (after a flag which if <span class="c1">nil</span> indicates that shifting
      is allowed on this object), it may be that the parent will be used. If the
      user types the name of an offspring object and an index indicating a
      shift, the parent object is determined from the parent property, and then
      the shift relative to the parent is computed, allowing shift() to proceed
      as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      As noted above, the symmetries of the offspring are determined from those
      of the parent. Any independent symmetry of the parent which, in the
      offspring, relates indices that are all covariant or contravariant (but
      not mixed) is retained. Thus, if the first index of the Riemann tensor is
      raised, only the anti-symmetry in the third and fourth indices survives,
      but if all the indices are raised, the offspring has the full Riemann
      symmetry. To ensure the most efficient operation of the system, the parent
      object should always be the most symmetric of the entire family of related
      objects, since shift() cannot determine if any new symmetries will appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally the application of the intrinsic symmetries of an object to
      canonicalize the index results in the indices being sorted into
      alphabetical order. If an index element is to be shifted, then it takes
      precedence when being sorted, so that indices shifting up are moved to the
      left, and indices shifting down are moved to the right. Thus, the
      canonical form of the shifted object takes priority over the canonical
      form of the index alone. For example,
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>hG[b,a];</I>

  hG
    a b

#: <I>hG[@b,a];</I>

    b
  hG
      a
</SPAN></PRE>
    Certain objects are shifted by contracting with things other than the
    metric; for these the user can change the altmetric property with the
    altmetric() command. This function takes the name of the object whose
    properties are being modified and the name of a rank-2 object that will be
    the alternate metric. With only one argument, altmetric() shows what metrics
    are defined for the given object.
    <p>
      The tensor metric itself has its indices raised to form the metric inverse
      via a matrix inverse computed by invert(); this function sets up the shift
      property on the metric, and also adds the proper delta function to
      represent a metric with mixed indices. The delta functions are created by
      the function delta(), but ordinarily this function need never be called by
      the user since the delta functions are created automatically for each kind
      of index in the system by defindextype(). The delta functions themselves
      form a family of three objects, one with both indices up, one with both
      down, and a mixed object. The names of the delta functions are by default
      of the form <span class="c1">d&lt;n&gt;_c</span>,
      <span class="c1">d&lt;n&gt;_d</span> and
      <span class="c1">d&lt;n&gt;</span>, respectively, where
      <span class="c1">&lt;n&gt;</span> is the type of index the delta function
      is defined for. Unlike the usual naming convention for the delta
      functions, <span class="c1">d&lt;n&gt;_c</span> is the parent, because it
      has the symmetries, but the mixed object, being most commonly used, is
      given the simpler name <span class="c1">d&lt;n&gt;</span>; this is the
      delta function used for the mixed metric.<br />
