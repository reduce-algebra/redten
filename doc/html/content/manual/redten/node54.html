      <a name="secredenv" id="secredenv"></a> The REDUCE environment consists of
      all <span class="c1">let</span> rules, assignments to algebraic variables,
      operators and switches. In working with a complicated metric it may be the
      case that a number of different, sometimes contradictory<a
        name="tex2html98"
        href="footnode.html#4503"
        id="tex2html98"
        ><img
          align="bottom"
          alt='.png"'
          src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"
      /></a>
      <span class="c1">let</span> rules and assignments may be used. Recalling
      which variables and <span class="c1">let</span> rules have been used, and
      properly clearing them can require more concentration than the task at
      hand. Thus, REDTEN has an enhancement to help the user in saving,
      restoring, and altering the REDUCE environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time the user makes an algebraic assignment, or declares a new
      operator, the name of the variable or operator is added to a global lisp
      list (!*reduce!-environment); this is done through a redefinition of
      certain REDUCE functions. The function addtoenv() also does this, adding
      each argument to the REDUCE environment list; with no arguments addtoenv()
      shows what names are included in the environment list. REDUCE stores
      <span class="c1">let</span> rules on certain lisp variables that are
      already in the environment list. Indexed objects are
      <em>not</em> considered to be part of the REDUCE environment, since it
      would be pointless to have their values restored to an original state
      after switching to an old environment. The user can, however, use
      addtoenv() to add an indexed object to the environment, presumably after
      it has reached some checkpoint state in simplification. Similarly, other
      objects created in REDUCE by means other than an assignment or operator
      command (eg. arrays) will not automatically be included in the
      environment, but can be added with addtoenv().
    </p>
    <p>
      As a general rule, the portion of the environment that changes with calls
      to restorenv() should involve secondary variables: those which are part of
      some larger expression plus <span class="c1">let</span> rules, and not the
      primary expression(s) being worked upon. Otherwise, as with indexed
      objects, it would defeat the purpose of having different environments. For
      reasons explained below, rather than providing a means to remove a symbol
      from the environment list, REDTEN allows the user to flag a variable so
      that its value will remain intact during environment switches. The flag
      keep prevents the system from saving or altering the value of a variable,
      it can be set via the command
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">  #: <I>lisp flag ('(var1, {var2}, ...), 'keep);
</I></SPAN></PRE>
    <i
      >Certain variables are already flagged <span class="c1">keep</span> and
      retain their values and property lists despite changing environments.
      Among these are currentmetric and reduce!-environment. Aside from the
      problem of losing a value if the environment is switched and the work
      variable is not flagged keep, it may well be that storing the values for
      this variable several times for the saved environments could lead to
      memory problems.</i
    >
    <p>
      <i
        >To save an environment requires that the property lists and lisp values
        of each symbol in the reduce environment be copied to some location, so
        that they can later be restored. The location used is based on the
        user-given name for the environment being saved. The restoration of a
        named environment copies back this information and overwrites the
        current property lists and values, thus changing the current set of
        assignments, operators and <span class="c1">let</span> rules. If the
        current environment is required for future use it must be saved first.
        If an environment is being restored in which a new operator etc. was not
        defined, that operator etc. will dissappear from the restored
        environment, but of course can returned if the current environment was
        saved. A named environment cannot be changed in any way, but it can
        always be restored, changed, and re-saved.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        >The primary functions that handle the saving and restoring of the
        REDUCE environment are savenv() and restorenv(). With no arguments,
        savenv() prints a list of the currently saved environments. When REDTEN
        is started, it saves the current environment as ``initial''<a
          name="tex2html99"
          href="footnode.html#4173"
          id="tex2html99"
          ><img
            align="bottom"
            alt='.png"'
            src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"
        /></a>
        (note that the environment name is an id, not a string). With a name as
        its single argument, savenv() saves the current environment with that
        name. The same name may be used to have restorenv() restore the
        environment. restorenv() will also save the current environment with the
        name ``current'', but note that this will be overwritten with each new
        restore. With no argument, restorenv() restores the last saved
        environment. If the argument given to restorenv() is not that of a valid
        environment, an error results.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        >Other useful functions are newenv(), swapenv(), delenv(), and
        renamenv(). newenv() saves the current environment as either ``current''
        or named by its single argument, then restores the ``initial''
        environment. It is equivalent to
        <span class="c1">savenv(&lt;name&gt;); restorenv(initial)</span>.
        swapenv() allows the user to quickly flip back and forth between two
        environments. Calling swapenv() with a single argument switches to that
        environment. Calling swapenv() again, with a different argument switches
        to the new environment. Thereafter, calling swapenv() with no arguments
        switches between the two environments. At any time, the user can begin
        switching to a different environment by calling swapenv() with a name.
        The swapping pair can be set up more quickly by giving two arguments,
        the first is made the current environment. Note that any changes made to
        the current environment will be temporarily saved under ``current'' when
        the environment changes, but will be lost after repeated switches.
        delenv() deletes the environment associated with the given argument, its
        main use is to clean up the system. renamenv() can be used to grab the
        <span class="c1">current</span> environment as saved by restorenv() and
        move it to a safe name.</i

        indicate the currently named environment. If changes have been made then
        the prompt also includes a '<span class="c1">+</span>' symbol. At system
        start-up the current environment is ``initial'':</i
