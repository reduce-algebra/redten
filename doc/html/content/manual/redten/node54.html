<P>
<A NAME=secredenv>&#160;</A>   The REDUCE environment consists of all <tt>let</tt> rules, assignments
to algebraic variables, operators and switches. In working with a
complicated metric it may be the case that a number of different,
sometimes contradictory<A NAME=tex2html98 HREF="footnode.html#4503"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.gif"></A> <tt>let</tt> rules and assignments may be used. Recalling
which variables and <tt>let</tt> rules have been used, and properly
clearing them can require more concentration than the task at hand.
Thus, REDTEN has an enhancement to help the user in saving,
restoring, and altering the REDUCE environment.
<P>
Each time the user makes an algebraic assignment, or declares a new
operator, the name of the variable or operator is added to a global
lisp list (!*reduce!-environment); this is done through a
redefinition of certain REDUCE functions.  The function
addtoenv() also does this, adding each argument to the REDUCE 
environment list; with no arguments addtoenv() shows what names
are included in the environment list.  REDUCE stores <tt>let</tt>
rules on certain lisp variables that are already in the environment
list. Indexed objects are <em>not</em> considered to be part of the
REDUCE environment, since it would be pointless to have their
values restored to an original state after switching to an old
environment. The user can, however, use addtoenv() to add an
indexed object to the environment, presumably after it has reached
some checkpoint state in simplification. Similarly, other objects
created in REDUCE by means other than an assignment or
operator command (eg. arrays) will  
not automatically be included in the environment, but can be added
with addtoenv().
<P>
As a general rule, the portion of the environment that changes with
calls to restorenv() should involve secondary variables: those
which are part of some larger expression plus <tt>let</tt> rules, and not
the primary expression(s) being worked upon.  Otherwise, as with
indexed objects, it would defeat the purpose of having different
environments. For reasons explained below, rather than providing a
means to remove a symbol from the environment list, REDTEN
allows the user to flag a variable so that its value will remain
intact during environment switches. The flag keep prevents the
system from saving or altering the value of a variable, it can be set
via the command
<PRE> 
<tt>  #: <i>lisp flag ('(var1, {var2}, ...), 'keep);
</tt></PRE>Certain variables are already flagged <tt>keep</tt> and retain their
values and property lists despite changing environments. Among these
are currentmetric and reduce!-environment.
Aside from the problem of losing a value if the environment is
switched and the work variable is not flagged keep, it may well
be that storing the values for this variable several times for 
the saved environments could lead to memory problems.
<P>
To save an environment requires that the property lists and lisp
values of each symbol in the reduce environment be copied to some
location, so that they can later be restored. The location used is
based on the user-given name for the environment being saved. The
restoration of a named environment copies back this information and
overwrites the current property lists and values, thus changing the
current set of assignments, operators and <tt>let</tt> rules. If the
current environment is required for future use it must be saved first.
If an
environment is being restored in which a new operator etc. was not defined,
that operator etc. will dissappear from the restored environment, but
of course can returned if the current environment was saved.
A named environment cannot be changed in any way, but it can always be
restored, changed, and re-saved.
<P>
The primary functions that handle the saving and restoring of the
REDUCE environment are savenv() and restorenv().  With
no arguments, savenv() prints a list of the currently saved
environments. When REDTEN is started, it saves the current
environment as ``initial''<A NAME=tex2html99 HREF="footnode.html#4173"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.gif"></A> (note that the
environment name is an id, not a string). With a name as its single
argument, savenv() saves the current environment with that name.
The same name may be used to have restorenv() restore the
environment. restorenv() will also save the current environment
with the name ``current'', but note that this will be overwritten with
each new restore. With no argument, restorenv() restores the
last saved environment. If the argument given to restorenv() is
not that of a valid environment, an error results.
<P>
 Other useful functions are newenv(), swapenv(),
delenv(), and renamenv(). 
newenv() saves the current environment as either ``current'' or
 named by its single argument, then restores the ``initial''
environment. It is  equivalent to <tt>savenv(&lt;name&gt;);
restorenv(initial)</tt>. swapenv() allows the user to quickly flip
back and forth between two environments. Calling swapenv() with
a single argument switches to that environment. Calling swapenv()
again, with a different argument switches to the new 
environment. Thereafter, calling swapenv() with no arguments
switches between the two environments. At any time, the user can begin
switching to a different environment by calling swapenv() with a
name. The swapping pair can be set up more quickly by giving two
arguments, the first is made the current environment.
Note that any changes made to the current environment will be
temporarily saved under ``current'' when the environment changes, but
will be lost after repeated switches. delenv() deletes the
environment associated with the given argument, its main use is to
clean up the system. renamenv() can be used to grab the <tt>current</tt>
environment as saved by restorenv() and move it to a safe name.
<P>
When the switch promptenv is turned on, the REDUCE prompt is
changed to indicate the currently named environment. If changes have
been made then the prompt also includes a '<tt>+</tt>' symbol. At system
start-up the current environment is ``initial'':
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>on promptenv;</i>

(initial) #: <i>a:=34;</i>

 a := 34

(initial)+ #: <i>savenv(adef);</i>

 adef

(adef) #:
