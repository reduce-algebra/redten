  <P><A name="secredenv" id="secredenv"></A> The REDUCE environment consists
  of all <SPAN class="c1">let</SPAN> rules, assignments to algebraic
  variables, operators and switches. In working with a complicated metric it
  may be the case that a number of different, sometimes contradictory<A name=
  "tex2html98" href="footnode.html#4503" id="tex2html98"><IMG align="bottom"
  alt=".png&quot;" src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A>
  <SPAN class="c1">let</SPAN> rules and assignments may be used. Recalling
  which variables and <SPAN class="c1">let</SPAN> rules have been used, and
  properly clearing them can require more concentration than the task at
  hand. Thus, REDTEN has an enhancement to help the user in saving,
  restoring, and altering the REDUCE environment.</P>
  <P>Each time the user makes an algebraic assignment, or declares a new
  operator, the name of the variable or operator is added to a global lisp
  list (!*reduce!-environment); this is done through a redefinition of
  certain REDUCE functions. The function addtoenv() also does this, adding
  each argument to the REDUCE environment list; with no arguments addtoenv()
  shows what names are included in the environment list. REDUCE stores
  <SPAN class="c1">let</SPAN> rules on certain lisp variables that are
  already in the environment list. Indexed objects are <EM>not</EM>
  considered to be part of the REDUCE environment, since it would be
  pointless to have their values restored to an original state after
  switching to an old environment. The user can, however, use addtoenv() to
  add an indexed object to the environment, presumably after it has reached
  some checkpoint state in simplification. Similarly, other objects created
  in REDUCE by means other than an assignment or operator command (eg.
  arrays) will not automatically be included in the environment, but can be
  added with addtoenv().</P>
  <P>As a general rule, the portion of the environment that changes with
  calls to restorenv() should involve secondary variables: those which are
  part of some larger expression plus <SPAN class="c1">let</SPAN> rules, and
  not the primary expression(s) being worked upon. Otherwise, as with indexed
  objects, it would defeat the purpose of having different environments. For
  reasons explained below, rather than providing a means to remove a symbol
  from the environment list, REDTEN allows the user to flag a variable so
  that its value will remain intact during environment switches. The flag
  keep prevents the system from saving or altering the value of a variable,
  it can be set via the command</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">  #: <I>lisp flag ('(var1, {var2}, ...), 'keep);
</I></SPAN></PRE><I>Certain variables are already flagged <SPAN class=
"c1">keep</SPAN> and retain their values and property lists despite changing
environments. Among these are currentmetric and reduce!-environment. Aside
from the problem of losing a value if the environment is switched and the
work variable is not flagged keep, it may well be that storing the values for
this variable several times for the saved environments could lead to memory
problems.</I>
  <P><I>To save an environment requires that the property lists and lisp
  values of each symbol in the reduce environment be copied to some location,
  so that they can later be restored. The location used is based on the
  user-given name for the environment being saved. The restoration of a named
  environment copies back this information and overwrites the current
  property lists and values, thus changing the current set of assignments,
  operators and <SPAN class="c1">let</SPAN> rules. If the current environment
  is required for future use it must be saved first. If an environment is
  being restored in which a new operator etc. was not defined, that operator
  etc. will dissappear from the restored environment, but of course can
  returned if the current environment was saved. A named environment cannot
  be changed in any way, but it can always be restored, changed, and
  re-saved.</I></P>
  <P><I>The primary functions that handle the saving and restoring of the
  REDUCE environment are savenv() and restorenv(). With no arguments,
  savenv() prints a list of the currently saved environments. When REDTEN is
  started, it saves the current environment as ``initial''<A name=
  "tex2html99" href="footnode.html#4173" id="tex2html99"><IMG align="bottom"
  alt=".png&quot;" src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A> (note that
  the environment name is an id, not a string). With a name as its single
  argument, savenv() saves the current environment with that name. The same
  name may be used to have restorenv() restore the environment. restorenv()
  will also save the current environment with the name ``current'', but note
  that this will be overwritten with each new restore. With no argument,
  restorenv() restores the last saved environment. If the argument given to
  restorenv() is not that of a valid environment, an error results.</I></P>
  <P><I>Other useful functions are newenv(), swapenv(), delenv(), and
  renamenv(). newenv() saves the current environment as either ``current'' or
  named by its single argument, then restores the ``initial'' environment. It
  is equivalent to <SPAN class="c1">savenv(&lt;name&gt;);
  restorenv(initial)</SPAN>. swapenv() allows the user to quickly flip back
  and forth between two environments. Calling swapenv() with a single
  argument switches to that environment. Calling swapenv() again, with a
  different argument switches to the new environment. Thereafter, calling
  swapenv() with no arguments switches between the two environments. At any
  time, the user can begin switching to a different environment by calling
  swapenv() with a name. The swapping pair can be set up more quickly by
  giving two arguments, the first is made the current environment. Note that
  any changes made to the current environment will be temporarily saved under
  ``current'' when the environment changes, but will be lost after repeated
  switches. delenv() deletes the environment associated with the given
  argument, its main use is to clean up the system. renamenv() can be used to
  grab the <SPAN class="c1">current</SPAN> environment as saved by
  restorenv() and move it to a safe name.</I></P>
  <P><I>When the switch promptenv is turned on, the REDUCE prompt is changed
  to indicate the currently named environment. If changes have been made then
  the prompt also includes a '<SPAN class="c1">+</SPAN>' symbol. At system
  start-up the current environment is ``initial'':</I></P>
