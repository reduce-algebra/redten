<P>
<A NAME=ssecaccess>&#160;</A>  There are a number of ways to examine the components of an indexed
object. The simplest is to specify the fixed index that refers to the
component of interest: the current value of the component will
immediately be read-out, and is available for use in algebraic
expressions. For example,
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>h[1,1];</i>
<P>
      2
  - rt

#: <i>df(h[2,2],t);</i>
<P>
                              2
   - 2 rt  sin(sqrt(k) om)  rt
         t
 ------------------------------
               k

</tt></PRE>To examine the object as a whole, two display formats are provided.
The first is obtained by attaching an empty index to the object, as in
<tt>h[]</tt>. For an indexed scalar, this is the only kind of index
allowed 
and results in the scalar value being
returned. For any other kind of object the existing explicit
components are displayed. Only those components that are actually
stored in the data structure are shown, and no evaluation takes place,
which also implies that a non-unit multiplier (qv) will not be
combined with the component.  Hence, an implicit object with no
explicit elements will appear to be empty. Components shown by this
display format may not match what would be shown by reading components
with fixed indices.  
Because the index is empty some objects, notably those derived from
the raising or lowering of indices of other objects, must be
referenced with their actual name (or the generic equivalent).
If the switch iprop is on, some of the properties listed in
&#167;<A HREF="node19.html#sseciobprops">2.2.6</A> are also shown.
<P>
The second display format is obtained when the literal character <tt>?</tt> is found
<A NAME=4122>&#160;</A>
(written as a normal index element) in a pattern or fixed index.
Those indices preceding this special character are used as part (or
all) of a pattern index, and any indices needed to fill out the index
are automatically generated.  Indices following the <tt>?</tt> are
ignored. The simplest way to examine the entire object is with <tt>h[?]</tt> which (for a rank-2 object) is equivalent to <tt>h[a,b,?]</tt>,
whereas to examine the first row one might use the command <tt>h[1,?]</tt>.
This format will also display some of the object properties, depending
on the setting of the iprop
 switch. The properties shown when the switch iprop is on can
also be seen, regardless of the switch setting, with the function
iprop() (qv).
<P>
The components are displayed by expanding the pattern index and
reading each component from the object. Thus, the user can select
segments of the object to display and will be shown the actual
read-out value. If the switch xeval
xeval
is on, an extra evaluation is made to reflect the
current state of algebraic variables.  This format
shows exactly what is in the object, as would be shown by accessing
each component directly with a specific fixed index, but only the
canonical elements are shown. This format will also show those
components that are zero (and usually are not stored and therefore not
displayed in the first format) unless the REDUCE switch nero
is on.
The index can also be used to indicate a shifted object, so that only
the parent name need be used, for example <tt>h[@a,@b,?]</tt>.
<P>

<P>
To see a directory of the objects created in the system, the function
dir() is provided. In its simplest form, with no arguments,
dir() displays all the objects in the system that have not been 
flagged with the nodir() (qv) function. The display shows the
object name, its type, the number of non-zero explicit components, the
state of the protection flags (qv), the coordinates and the index
structure. With arguments dir() shows information about the named
objects.
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>dir(); </i>

  name          type          comp    prot  coordinates     indextype

</tt></PRE>The current-metrics are indicated by the <tt>*</tt> at the beginning of
the display line.
