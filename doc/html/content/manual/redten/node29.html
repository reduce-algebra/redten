  <P><A name="algebra" id="algebra"></A> In this chapter we will show how to
  write expressions that both involve indexed objects, and which evaluate to
  indexed objects. It was intended from the outset in the design of REDTEN
  that the user be able to write tensor expressions in a convenient form, and
  have them displayed in as close to publication form as was practical.</P>
  <P>Whenever the user enters an indexed object with a pattern index (an
  index in which at least one element is an identifier and not an integer)
  the indexed object is returned unevaluated (unless the intrinsic symmetries
  of the object allow an immediate simplification to zero). This has already
  been seen in the previous chapter, where the concept of an indexed object
  reference was demonstrated. Now we shall use this to build expressions that
  can then be used to create new indexed objects.</P>
  <P>An ``indexed expression'' consists of the algebraic combination of
  indexed objects such that the indices involved obey the rules set out
  below. An indexed expression is a normal REDUCE expression and can be
  assigned to REDUCE variables, however, if this is done there is no checking
  of the index structure or other evaluation except for the usual
  canonicaliztion of indices until the expression is used in an ``indexed
  assignment''.</P>
  <P><A name="813" id="813"></A> An indexed expression can be as simple
  as</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>r[a,b];</I>
</SPAN></PRE>or as complicated as need be, given certain rules about indices
and the combinations that are valid. In any indexed expression there will be
some index elements that are non-integer (otherwise each indexed object
reference can be immediately evaluated and a simple algebraic expression
results). The labels used for each of these index-elements are arbitrary
except for the following restrictions:
  <UL>
    <LI>In a product of indexed objects, a repeated index element represents
    the Einstein summation convention (a ``contraction''), and the two
    indices must appear in covariant and contravariant positions. Having more
    than two repeated indices is an error, although this will not be
    indicated until the indexed assignment is evaluated. If the switch
    extendedsum is on, then the two repeated indices may also be both
    covariant or both contravariant.</LI>
    <LI>After the contractions are eliminated, the remaining indices must
    match the index structure of the output object in both location (i.e.
    either covariant or contravariant) and type.</LI>
  </UL>These are of course just the usual rules for indices in tensor
  analysis.
  <P>The net index structure of the expression, obtained by eliminating the
  contractions and fixed indices, will be the same as that of the object to
  which the expression will eventually be assigned. Ideally, this object
  would be created by the user before the assignment takes place, so that
  proper checking of the index structure of the expression relative to that
  expected in the output object can be done. The user can also avoid
  declaring the object, in which case the system will prompt as soon as an
  index is placed on it, or the user can make a ``bare'' declaration (see
  page <A href="node20.html#mkobjbare"><IMG align="bottom" alt=".png&quot;"
  src="../../../images/latex/cross_ref_motif.png"></A>), and the system will
  determine the net index structure of the expression and place the indextype
  parameter on the object. This is not recommended.</P>
  <P>The net symmetries of the expression are in general very difficult to
  determine by a simple algorithm, thus it is up to the user to correctly
  place these on the output object. Failing to do so can result in very long
  run times for some expressions, since the system uses the output objects'
  symmetries to generate the indices it uses to perform the evaluation.</P>
  <P>Continuing with the Robertson-Walker metric example from the last
  chapter, we can now construct the two kinds of Christoffel symbols <A name=
  "823" id="823"></A> from the metric tensor. In tensor notation these are
  defined by:</P>
  <P><A name="eqc2" id="eqc2"></A> <A name="eqc1" id="eqc1"></A><IMG align=
  "bottom" src="_10787_eqnarray824.png"></P>
  <P>where <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6246.png"> is the
  metric tensor. Unfortunately, REDTEN does not have quite the flexibility of
  input for the user to use this exact formalism, so we must resort to making
  these rank-3 objects with, for example, the names <SPAN class=
  "c1">hc1</SPAN> and <SPAN class="c1">hc2</SPAN> respectively. In actual
  fact, neither of the Christoffel symbols is a tensor, but in the GR package
  of REDTEN they are declared as such (with the generic names c1 and c2),
  since certain combinations of these objects are tensors.</P>
  <P>It can be seen that the first Christoffel symbol is symmetric in its
  first two indices <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6252.png">
  and <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6254.png">, while the
  second Christoffel symbol is symmetric in its second and third indices,
  again <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6252.png"> and
  <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6254.png">, taking the upper
  index <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6408.png"> to be the
  first. We can then declare these objects, giving them the proper index
  structure and symmetries:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class=

</SPAN></PRE>The Christoffel symbols can be evaluated by:
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class=
"c1">#: <I>hc1[i,j,k] == (h[i,k,|j] + h[j,k,|i] - h[i,j,|k])/2;</I>

               - h        + h        + h
                  i j |k     i k |j     j k |i

      i j

#: <I>hc1[0,1,1];</I>

  - rt  rt
      t
</SPAN></PRE>We first observe that indexed assignments are done using the
same <SPAN class="c1">==</SPAN> operator that was used to write individual
components to indexed <A name="855" id="855"></A> <A name="4123" id=
"4123"></A> objects, since that operation is a simple form of indexed
assignment. Immediately after the input line has been parsed and depending on
the setting of the switch rewrite the system will ``pretty-print'' the
expression to show the user the index structure of the left and right hand
sides. If these do not match, an error message will be forthcoming.
  <P>The system then begins the process of parsing the expression and
  evaluating each component for the left hand object. If the switch
  showindices is on, each components index is displayed on the screen as the
  assignment proceeds. This is useful for complicated objects, where the time
  to accomplish the assignment may be several minutes and it is desired to
  monitor the progress of the calculation. The proper display of these
  indices depends on the correct setting of the variable upcursor, see
  Appendix <A href="node66.html#starting">F</A> for more information. A
  related switch is peek which also shows if the current component evaluates
  to zero or non-zero.</P>
  <P>The expression for <SPAN class="c1">hc1</SPAN> involves the ordinary
  differentiation operator <SPAN class="c1">|</SPAN>; when this is
  encountered the system will create a new object to store the derivatives
  for future reference. This is described more fully in ยง<A href=
  "node34.html#secodf">4.1</A>. In the calculation of <SPAN class=
  "c1">hc2</SPAN> it will be observed that the shift operator <SPAN class=
  "c1">@</SPAN> has been used on the metric indices. In general, when an
  indexed object reference is parsed, the system checks for these operators,
  and, if the corresponding shifted object exists, the reference is rewritten
  in terms of this object directly. Thus, typing <SPAN class=
  "c1">h[@a,@b]</SPAN> is equivalent to typing <SPAN class=
  "c1">h_inv[a,b]</SPAN>, since the inverse object already exists. If it did
  not, the operations would be held pending an indexed assignment, and at
  that time the shift() function would be called to construct the new object.
  That is, the system does as much simplifcation as it can on the expression
  as initially entered, but waits until it is involved in an indexed
  assignment to undertake any time-consuming calculations. The expression for
  <SPAN class="c1">hc2</SPAN> also contains a contraction representing the
  summation over the index <SPAN class="c1">k</SPAN>. It is here that the
  diagonal symmetry of the metric can be used effectively, since the
  summation in this case reduces to a single term.</P>
  <P>It will also be observed that the indexed objects in the first of these
  calculations are involved in an algebraic expression (a quotient). This is
  a very simple case of a more general property of indexed expressions in
  REDTEN: an indexed object can be an argument to an algebraic function; the
  components of the indexed object are evaluated in the context of the
  function as the indexed expression is evaluated. For example,</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>k[a,b]==sub(s=1, h[a,b])$</I>

#: <I>l[a,b]==df(h[a,b],om)$</I>
</SPAN></PRE>
  <P>With the Christoffel symbols in hand, we can now proceed to evaluate the
  Riemann curvature tensor, which is defined in terms of the Christoffel
  symbols by:</P>
  <P><A name="eqriemann" id="eqriemann"></A><IMG align="bottom" src=
  "_10787_equation878.png"></P>
  <P>It can be shown from symmetry considerations that there are only 21
  independent components of the Riemann tensor in a four-dimensional
  space-time, rather than the 256 components there appear to be<A name=
  "tex2html74" href="footnode.html#4128" id="tex2html74"><IMG align="bottom"
  alt=".png&quot;" src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A>. The
  Riemann tensor is anti-symmetric in the first and second indices,
  anti-symmetric in the third and fourth indices, and symmetric in blocks of
  two indices starting at the first and third. In REDTEN notation, this
  symmetry list is written as <SPAN class="c1">'((-1 1 2) (-1 3 4) (2 1
  3))</SPAN> and the Riemann tensor <SPAN class="c1">hR</SPAN> can be made
  with the command:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class=
"c1">#: <I>mkobj ('hR, '(-1 -1 -1 -1), '((-1 1 2) (-1 3 4) (2 1 3)), '(),
'riemann);</I>

 hR
   a b c d
</SPAN></PRE>Recall that the name R is declared generic in REDTEN and should
not be used to create a Riemann tensor (the name <SPAN class="c1">R</SPAN> is
however closely related to the Riemann tensors created with the GR package).
The assignment to the Riemann tensor is made as follows:
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class=
"c1">#: <I>hR[h,i,j,k] == hc1[i,k,h,|j]-hc1[i,j,h,|k]+hc2[l,i,j]*hc1[h,k,l]
  -hc2[l,i,k]*hc1[h,j,l];</I>

                              l                     l
 hR         =  - hc1       hc2       + hc1       hc2
   h i j k          h j l       i k       h k l       i j

  - hc1          + hc1
       i j h |k       i k h |j

 hR
   h i j k

</SPAN></PRE>If the user examines this object it will be seen that there are
only 6 non-zero components. On a reasonably fast computer (eg. a 25Mhz 386 or
a SUN) this calculation takes only a few seconds for this metric; for more
complicated metrics it will of course take longer.
  <P>The next objects to create are the Ricci tensor and the associated Ricci
  scalar (also called the scalar curvature). These are defined by</P>
  <P><A name="eqricsc" id="eqricsc"></A> <A name="eqricci" id=
  "eqricci"></A><IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_eqnarray909.png"></P>
  <P>The Ricci tensor is symmetric, hence:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>mkobj('hRic, '(-1 -1), '((1 1 2)), '(), 'ricci);</I>

 hRic
     a b

</SPAN></PRE>is the command to make the object. There are two ways to compute
the components of both the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar, in REDTEN one
method is somewhat more efficient than the other. The first method is to
indicate a shift operation with the <SPAN class="c1">@</SPAN> operator, this
will cause the system to create a new object (whose name is derived from the
name of the object being shifted, see ยง<A href=
"node32.html#ssecshift">3.1.2</A> for more detail). The internal contraction
of the object is then done to yield the output object:
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>hRic[i,j] == hR[@k,i,j,k];</I>

               k
  hRic     = hR
      i j        i j k

computing hR_b
SHIFT finished.

  hRic
      i j
</SPAN></PRE>A side effect of this method is the creation of <SPAN class=
"c1">hR_b</SPAN>, a Riemann tensor with the first index raised, and,
incidentally, fewer symmetries than the original Riemann tensor. Thus, it can
take appreciably longer to compute this object since it has many more
components (12 non-zero ones for this metric). Since we probably are not
interested in this object this particular method is not the most efficient
way to compute the Ricci tensor. Instead, we shall write the metric
contraction explicitly, so that the system simply does a two-index
contraction:
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>hRic[i,j] == h[@l,@k]*hR[l,i,j,k];</I>

                           k l
 hRic     =  - hR         h
     i j         i l j k

 hRic
     i j

</SPAN></PRE>This calculation computes directly the object of interest and
proceeds much more quickly than the first method. Since the contraction
involves all the indices of the metric inverse, it will be read-out when the
expression is processed (before the actual evaluation of output components
begins) yeilding a substantial simplification. It will also be observed that
the expression as echoed by the system is not identical to that typed in,
since the indices have been canonicalized and, in the case of the Riemann
tensor, a sign change was introduced.
  <P>We can similarly evaluate the Ricci scalar using the more efficient
  metric contraction:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>hRsc == h[@i,@j]*hRic[i,j];</I>

                  i j
 hRsc = hRic     h
            i j

                   2
  6 (rt    rt + rt   + k)
       t,2        t
 -------------------------
              2
            rt

</SPAN></PRE>Note that we did <EM>not</EM> declare <SPAN class=
"c1">hRsc</SPAN> in advance. The indexed expression on the right hand side
evaluates to a scalar and REDTEN will accept a REDUCE scalar as the output
object in this case. In fact, the left hand side can either be an indexed
object or a scalar, and the right hand side can be any indexed expression,
scalar expression, or simple scalar.
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>w[a,b] == 99; % write 99 into every component of w</I>

  w
   a b
</SPAN></PRE>This example is not generally very useful unless perhaps to set
every component of an object to zero. Of course, mixed indices may also be
used, in order to limit the assignment to a row or column etc. Only if the
right hand side is indexed is it necessary for the left-hand side to be
similarly indexed. One can always assign an indexed expression to an object
of higher rank; the extra indices may be fixed or pattern indices, if the
latter, then the expression is assigned to every possible combination of
indices. An error will occur if a pattern index-element on the right hand
side is unmatched by a similar one on the left.
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>w[a,b] == p[a]; % this is ok</I>

 w
  a b

#: <I>p[a] == w[a,b]; % this is an error</I>

Error: free index element b in w[a,b].
</SPAN></PRE>The first assignment will replicate <SPAN class="c1">p</SPAN>
(assumed to have been created and given some values) into the columns of
<SPAN class="c1">w</SPAN>. The second assignment fails because there is no
index element corresponding to <SPAN class="c1">b</SPAN> on the left hand
side (it is a ``free'' index element). If, however, <SPAN class="c1">w</SPAN>
were zero (i.e. with no explicit components and also not implicit) then the
assignment would proceed, because the expression
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">w
 a b
</SPAN></PRE>is replaced by zero before the index checking is done. If
<SPAN class="c1">b</SPAN> were replaced by a valid integer then the
assignment could again proceed.
  <P>As noted above, the index of the output object can be such that only a
  portion of the object is referenced during the indexed assignment
  operation. In this case, any components that are not included in the scope
  of the index remain unchanged; the new components are merged with the old.
  If the user decides that an indexed assignment applied to an object with
  previously defined components has been an error, the old value of the
  object can be recovered by calling restoreobj() immediately.</P>
  <P>The function seval() is used to perform the evaluation of an indexed
  expression that reduces to a scalar, without the need for an indexed
  assignment using <SPAN class="c1">==</SPAN>. Thus, the dimension of the
  space-time can be found by</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>seval(h[@a,@b]*h[a,b]);</I>

                a b
 seval = h     h
          a b

  4

</SPAN></PRE>In fact, this function calls the indexed assignment operator and
assigns the result to the name seval.
  <P>The left hand side of these scalar expression can also be an indexed
  scalar, declared by giving mkobj() an empty indextype property (see
  ยง<A href="node13.html#mkobjindextype">2.2.2</A>). In this case the empty
  index must be attached to the object name.</P>
  <P>Another scalar of interest is formed by contracting the Riemann tensor
  with itself. The Kretschmann scalar is defined by</P>
  <P><A name="eqkretsch" id="eqkretsch"></A><IMG align="bottom" src=
  "_10787_equation967.png"></P>
  <P>We can declare it to be an indexed scalar via</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>mkobj('hkrtch, '(), '(), '(), 'kretschmann);</I>

</SPAN></PRE>and evaluate it as follows:
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>hkrtch[] == hR[@a,@b,@c,@d]*hR[a,b,c,d];</I>

                   rt

</SPAN></PRE>In this instance we allowed the system to create the shifted
Riemann tensor <SPAN class="c1">hR_p</SPAN> because it has the same
symmetries as <SPAN class="c1">hR</SPAN> (and is not too expensive to
compute), but the expression could have been written with the metric inverse
explicitly. Note that forgetting the empty index on <SPAN class=
"c1">hkrtch</SPAN> is likely to lead to a syntax error. In order to examine
the value of <SPAN class="c1">hkrtch</SPAN> it is also necessary to add the
expty index, the name alone has itself as its value.
  <P>The remaining objects of interest for the RW metric are the Einstein
  tensor and the Weyl curvature tensor, defined by:</P>
  <P><A name="eqweyl" id="eqweyl"></A> <A name="eqeinstein" id=
  "eqeinstein"></A><IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_eqnarray982.png"></P>
  <P>These object are closely related to the Ricci tensor and the Riemann
  tensor, respectively, with the same index structure and symmetries and can
  be created in the following way using the extended mkobj() syntax described
  in ยง<A href="node13.html#mkobjindextype">2.2.2</A> and ยง<A href=
  "node14.html#mkobjsym">2.2.3</A>:</P>

</SPAN></PRE>It will be observed that in the expression for the Weyl tensor
the name <SPAN class="c1">h</SPAN> is used both for an index and as the
metric. Ordinarily there is no conflict between a name used in an index and
the same name used for any other indexed object or algebraic variable, unless
the switch evalindex is on (qv). If the contents of the Weyl tensor are
examined, it will be found that there are no explicit values, as is to be
expected since the RW metric is conformally flat.
