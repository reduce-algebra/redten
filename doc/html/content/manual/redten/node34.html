  <P><A name="secodf" id="secodf"></A> <A name="1187" id="1187"></A> <A name=
  "1188" id="1188"></A> As of REDTEN version v3.3 the ordinary
  differentiation code was entirely rewritten to make use of automatically
  created objects to store the derivatives of other objects. This change was
  intended to improve the performance of the system by avoiding the
  unnecessary re-computation of derivatives, and to simplify the code. When
  an objects' index indicates an ordinary differentiation and the object is
  involved in an indexed assignment, the system will either store a newly
  computed derivative or retrieve an existing value from the derivative
  object. Higher order derivatives cause multiple objects to be created, each
  containing the derivative of the previous object and having a rank one
  greater.</P>
  <P>The automatically created derivative objects have names of the form
  <SPAN class="c1">&lt;name&gt;_DF&lt;#&gt;</SPAN> where <SPAN class=
  "c1">&lt;name&gt;</SPAN> is the name of the object whose derivative is
  being computed, and <SPAN class="c1">&lt;#&gt;</SPAN> is an integer,
  starting from 2, that distinguishes higher order objects. The indextype is
  formed by adding enough covariant tensor indices to those already on the
  parent object to match the order of the derivative. This is strictly
  incorrect, since ordinary derivative indices do not transform as tensor
  indices, but it is much more convenient to regard them as such. The user is
  responsible for ensuring that combinations of objects having ordinary
  derivative indices are in fact tensors. For derivatives of order 2 or
  higher, the derivative indices are symmetric because of the commutative
  property of differentiation; the derivative objects also inherit the
  intrinsic symmetries of the parent object.</P>
  <P>When created on the fly the derivative objects are filled with the
  hitherto unmentioned value <SPAN class="c1">&lt;undefined&gt;</SPAN> (which
  cannot be entered by the user) so as to distinguish between components that
  have been evaluated and those which have not. Thus, a derivative object may
  be ``incomplete'' after being created automatically, since the indexed
  algebra may not have touched on all the possible components. The user can
  fully evaluate any order derivative of an object via the function odf(),
  which takes the object name as the first argument, and odf() the order of
  the derivative as the optional second argument. Objects so created are
  visible in a directory listing, but the automatic objects are flagged nodir
  and are hidden unless the <SPAN class="c1">all</SPAN> keyword (or the
  <SPAN class="c1"><CODE>*</CODE></SPAN> pattern) is used. Since the number
  of real components is uncertain for the automatic objects, a directory
  listing will usually display a large number of components (representing the
  full number of possible components each with the value <SPAN class=
  "c1">&lt;undefined&gt;</SPAN>), followed by a <SPAN class="c1">?</SPAN> to
  indicate the uncertainty. Using odf() also causes the derivatives and the
  parent to become write protected.</P>
  <P>The derivative objects are given the <SPAN class="c1">itype</SPAN> odf
  and form a chain starting from the parent; each object stores its order and
  the objects that are its anti-derivative and derivative under the odf
  property. See the function <SPAN class="c1">getfam()</SPAN> for information
  on how to simplify both the parent object and its derivatives at the same
  time.</P>
  <P>The derivative objects are set up with a printname that is the parent
  objects' printname, and their indices are printed with the appropriate
  differentiation symbols in place. For example, if <SPAN class="c1">q</SPAN>
  is a rank-1 indexed object, the user can create its 3rd-order derivative
  via</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>odf(q,3);</I>
computing q_DF3 

  q_DF3
</SPAN></PRE>and a display of the components of this object would appear as
follows:
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>q_DF3[];</I>

  0
 q         = &lt;value&gt;
    |0 0 0

  0
 q         = &lt;value&gt;
    |0 0 1

etc.
</SPAN></PRE>The user may also cause the automatic creation of the derivative
objects by entering a fixed index containing a derivative operator. The
required derivatives are computed and immediately returned, and also stored
in the derivative objects. For example,
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: R[1,2,1,2,|0];
                           2                   2
   - (2 rt  sin(sqrt(k) om)  rt) (rt   rt + rt   + k)
          t                         2t        t
