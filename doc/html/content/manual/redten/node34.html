      <a name="secodf" id="secodf"></a> <a name="1187" id="1187"></a>
      <a name="1188" id="1188"></a> As of REDTEN version v3.3 the ordinary
      differentiation code was entirely rewritten to make use of automatically
      created objects to store the derivatives of other objects. This change was
      intended to improve the performance of the system by avoiding the
      unnecessary re-computation of derivatives, and to simplify the code. When
      an objects' index indicates an ordinary differentiation and the object is
      involved in an indexed assignment, the system will either store a newly
      computed derivative or retrieve an existing value from the derivative
      object. Higher order derivatives cause multiple objects to be created,
      each containing the derivative of the previous object and having a rank
      one greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      The automatically created derivative objects have names of the form
      <span class="c1">&lt;name&gt;_DF&lt;#&gt;</span> where
      <span class="c1">&lt;name&gt;</span> is the name of the object whose
      derivative is being computed, and <span class="c1">&lt;#&gt;</span> is an
      integer, starting from 2, that distinguishes higher order objects. The
      indextype is formed by adding enough covariant tensor indices to those
      already on the parent object to match the order of the derivative. This is
      strictly incorrect, since ordinary derivative indices do not transform as
      tensor indices, but it is much more convenient to regard them as such. The
      user is responsible for ensuring that combinations of objects having
      ordinary derivative indices are in fact tensors. For derivatives of order
      2 or higher, the derivative indices are symmetric because of the
      commutative property of differentiation; the derivative objects also
      inherit the intrinsic symmetries of the parent object.
    </p>
    <p>
      When created on the fly the derivative objects are filled with the
      hitherto unmentioned value
      <span class="c1">&lt;undefined&gt;</span> (which cannot be entered by the
      user) so as to distinguish between components that have been evaluated and
      those which have not. Thus, a derivative object may be ``incomplete''
      after being created automatically, since the indexed algebra may not have
      touched on all the possible components. The user can fully evaluate any
      order derivative of an object via the function odf(), which takes the
      object name as the first argument, and odf() the order of the derivative
      as the optional second argument. Objects so created are visible in a
      directory listing, but the automatic objects are flagged nodir and are
      hidden unless the <span class="c1">all</span> keyword (or the
      <span class="c1"><code>*</code></span> pattern) is used. Since the number
      of real components is uncertain for the automatic objects, a directory
      listing will usually display a large number of components (representing
      the full number of possible components each with the value
      <span class="c1">&lt;undefined&gt;</span>), followed by a
      <span class="c1">?</span> to indicate the uncertainty. Using odf() also
      causes the derivatives and the parent to become write protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The derivative objects are given the <span class="c1">itype</span> odf and
      form a chain starting from the parent; each object stores its order and
      the objects that are its anti-derivative and derivative under the odf
      property. See the function <span class="c1">getfam()</span> for
      information on how to simplify both the parent object and its derivatives
      at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The derivative objects are set up with a printname that is the parent
      objects' printname, and their indices are printed with the appropriate
      differentiation symbols in place. For example, if
      <span class="c1">q</span> is a rank-1 indexed object, the user can create
      its 3rd-order derivative via
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>odf(q,3);</I>
computing q_DF3 

  q_DF3
</SPAN></PRE>
    and a display of the components of this object would appear as follows:
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>q_DF3[];</I>

  0
 q         = &lt;value&gt;
    |0 0 0

  0
 q         = &lt;value&gt;
    |0 0 1

etc.
</SPAN></PRE>
    The user may also cause the automatic creation of the derivative objects by
    entering a fixed index containing a derivative operator. The required
    derivatives are computed and immediately returned, and also stored in the
    derivative objects. For example,
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: R[1,2,1,2,|0];
                           2                   2
   - (2 rt  sin(sqrt(k) om)  rt) (rt   rt + rt   + k)
          t                         2t        t
 -----------------------------------------------------
                           k 
</SPAN></PRE>
