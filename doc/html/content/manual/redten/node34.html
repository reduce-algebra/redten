 As of REDTEN version v3.3 the ordinary differentiation code was
entirely rewritten to make use of automatically created objects to
store the derivatives of other objects. This change was intended to
improve the performance of the system by avoiding the unnecessary
re-computation of derivatives, and to simplify the code. When an
objects' index indicates an ordinary differentiation and the object is
involved in an indexed assignment, the system will either store a
newly computed derivative or retrieve an existing value from the
derivative object. Higher order derivatives cause multiple objects to
be created, each containing the derivative of the previous object and
having a rank one greater.
<P>
The automatically created derivative objects have names of the form
<tt>&lt;name&gt;_DF&lt;#&gt;</tt> where <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> is the name of the object
whose derivative is being computed, and <tt>&lt;#&gt;</tt> is an integer,
starting from 2, that distinguishes higher order objects. The
indextype is formed by adding enough covariant tensor indices to
those already on the parent object to match the order of the
derivative. This is strictly incorrect, since ordinary derivative
indices do not transform as tensor indices, but it is much more
convenient to regard them as such. The user is responsible for
ensuring that combinations of objects having ordinary derivative
indices are in fact tensors.  For derivatives of order 2 or higher,
the derivative indices are symmetric because of the commutative
property of differentiation; the derivative objects also inherit the
intrinsic symmetries of the parent object.
<P>
When created on the fly the derivative objects are filled with the
hitherto unmentioned value <tt>&lt;undefined&gt;</tt> (which cannot be entered
by the user) so as to distinguish between components that have been
evaluated and those which have not. Thus, a derivative object may be
``incomplete'' after being created automatically, since the indexed
algebra may not have touched on all the possible components. The user
can fully evaluate any order derivative of an object via the function
odf(), which takes the object name as the first argument, and
odf()
the order of the derivative as the optional second argument. Objects
so created are visible in a directory listing, but the automatic
objects are flagged nodir and are hidden unless the <tt>all</tt>
keyword (or the <tt><code>*</code></tt> pattern)
 is used. Since the number of real components is uncertain for
the automatic objects, a directory listing will usually display a
large number of components (representing the full number of possible
components each with the value <tt>&lt;undefined&gt;</tt>), followed by a <tt>?</tt> to indicate the uncertainty.  Using odf() also causes the
derivatives and the parent to become write protected.
<P>
The derivative objects are given the <tt>itype</tt> odf and form a
chain starting from the parent; each object stores its order and the
objects that are its anti-derivative and derivative under the
odf property. See the function <tt>getfam()</tt> for information on
how to simplify both the parent object and its derivatives at the same
time.
<P>
The derivative objects are set up with a printname that is the
parent objects' printname, and their indices are printed with
the appropriate differentiation symbols in place. For example, if <tt>q</tt> is a rank-1 indexed object, the user can create its 3rd-order
derivative via
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>odf(q,3);</i>
computing q_DF3 

  q_DF3
</tt></PRE>and a display of the components of this object would appear as follows:
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>q_DF3[];</i>

  0
 q         = &lt;value&gt;
    |0 0 0

  0
 q         = &lt;value&gt;
    |0 0 1

etc.
</tt></PRE>The user may also cause the automatic creation of the derivative
objects by entering a fixed index containing a derivative operator.
The required derivatives are computed and immediately returned, and
also stored in the derivative objects. For example,
<PRE> 
<tt>#: R[1,2,1,2,|0];
                           2                   2
   - (2 rt  sin(sqrt(k) om)  rt) (rt   rt + rt   + k)
          t                         2t        t
