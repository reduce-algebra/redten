  <P><A name="sseccomp" id="sseccomp"></A> To make use of this metric we must
  first set the correct coordinates as above, and then create an appropriate
  indexed object and enter values for its components. Since this is a metric
  tensor, it will have two covariant tensor indices, and will be
  symmetric:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>mkobj ('h, '(-1 -1), '((1 1 2)), '(), 'metric);</I>

 h
  a b

#: <I>depend rt, t;</I>

#: <I>let s = sin(sqrt(k)*om)/sqrt(k);</I>
</SPAN></PRE>Notice that we have set up the object so that the itype is
<SPAN class="c1">metric</SPAN>, and have used an empty list for the undesired
implicit parameter. It is common to use the name g for a metric, but in
REDTEN it has been made into a ``<B>generic</B>'' (qv) name, and should not
be disturbed; we shall use <SPAN class="c1">h</SPAN> in this example instead.
We have also set up the time-dependence of <SPAN class="c1">rt</SPAN> (using
<SPAN class="c1">rt</SPAN> instead of R, since <SPAN class="c1">R</SPAN> is
generic too) and defined a <SPAN class="c1">let</SPAN> rule to evaluate
<IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6244.png">. This last part could
be done as easily with a REDUCE assignment.
  <P>There are two ways to enter the values of the components of <SPAN class=
  "c1">h</SPAN>. The first method involves the expected assignment operation,
  where the left-hand side, referring to a specific element with a fixed
  index, is assigned the value on the right hand side. Unlike the normal
  REDUCE assignment operation which uses the symbol <SPAN class=
  "c1">:=</SPAN>, the <A name="689" id="689"></A> <A name="690" id="690"></A>
  <A name="691" id="691"></A> REDTEN indexed assignment operation uses the
  symbol <SPAN class="c1">==</SPAN>. Attempting to assign a value to an
  indexed object element with the <SPAN class="c1">:=</SPAN> operator will
  result in a REDUCE <SPAN class="c1">Missing Operator</SPAN> error mclear()
  message<A name="tex2html64" href="footnode.html#4113" id=
  "tex2html64"><IMG align="bottom" alt=".png&quot;" src=
  "../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A>. We can proceed as follows:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>h[0,0] == 1;</I>

   1

#: <I>h[1,1] == -rt^2;</I>

      2
   -rt

#: <I>h[2,2] == -s^2*rt^2;</I>

                    2   2
   - sin(sqrt(k) om)  rt
 -------------------------
             k

#: <I>h[3,3] == -sin(th)^2*s^2*rt^2;</I>

                    2        2   2
   - sin(sqrt(k) om)  sin(th)  rt
 ----------------------------------
                 k

</SPAN></PRE>As each value is entered, the system then reads the object to
determine the actual value stored for that component, since it is possible
for the assignment to fail due to symmetries or write-protection of the
object. These are explicit components for <SPAN class="c1">h</SPAN>, and
since <SPAN class="c1">h</SPAN> was not declared as an ``implicit'' object,
any missing components are taken as 0. If any component already had a
non-zero value, that value is overwritten (unless the object is
write-protected).
  <P>When a large number of elements are to be assigned to the same object, a
  more convenient method is to use the function ias(). This function takes an
  indexed object as input and guides the user through the assignment process.
  At its simplest, ias() attempts to assign to the whole object, keeping in
  mind the intrinsic symmetries that are present. The user may also attach an
  index that indicates the assignments are to be to a particular row or
  column of the object. Using ias() the assignment to <SPAN class=
  "c1">h</SPAN> would proceed as follows:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>ias(h);</I>
  h[0,0] = <I>1;</I>
  h[0,1] = <I>;</I>
  h[0,2] = <I>;</I>
  h[0,3] = <I>;</I>
  h[1,1] = <I>-rt^2;</I>
  h[1,2] = <I>;</I>
  h[1,3] = <I>;</I>
  h[2,2] = <I>-s^2*rt^2;</I>
  h[2,3] = <I>;</I>
  h[3,3] = <I>-sin(th)^2*s^2*rt^2;</I>

  h
</SPAN></PRE>At each prompt the user may enter the desired value; a
semi-colon alone is equivalent to zero. If the user types <SPAN class=
"c1">nil</SPAN><A name="tex2html65" href="footnode.html#4120" id=
"tex2html65"><IMG align="bottom" alt=".png&quot;" src=
"../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A> then the assignment process is
terminated, and any remaining unassigned components will be unchanged.
  <P>The function iclear() can be used to remove all of the components of
  several indexed objects (and the multiplier), without disturbing any of the
  other properties.</P>
  <P>So far we have created only a rank-2 object with some symmetries and
  values, the rest of the structure associated with a metric is not yet
  present. The function metric() is used to fully qualify an object as a
  metric: it attaches the required properties, adjusts some system variables
  and creates the metric inverse. We may apply metric() to <SPAN class=
  "c1">h</SPAN> very simply:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>metric(h);</I>

 invert finished.

 h
</SPAN></PRE>At the end of this process <SPAN class="c1">h</SPAN> has been
declared the ``current-metric'', and its name is installed in the system
variable currentmetric. Among other things, this means that <SPAN class="c1">
  h</SPAN> will be used by shift() when raising or lowering tensor indices.
  The generic metric <A name="745" id="745"></A> g will also refer to this
  object (see <A href="node38.html#secgenerics">4.3</A>). The metric inverse
  will be given the name <SPAN class="c1">h_inv</SPAN>, it is created from
  the metric by the matrix function invert() (qv). <A name="750" id=
  "750"></A> The indexed object passed to metric() must be a rank-2 covariant
  object, and is assumed to be symmetric. If it is actually diagonal (as this
  example is), the symmetry will be adjusted to reflect this. A diagonal
  symmetry helps the system to run faster for many operations involving the
  metric, particularly in the raising and lowering of indices with shift().
  <P>metric() can also be used to create a new indexed object suitable for
  filling with metric coefficients. To do this, give metric() no arguments,
  the object it creates will have a name in the usual sequence of metric
  objects described below. After the user has entered the metric
  coefficients, metric() should be called again as demonstrated above to
  finish the job of setting up the metric. In this situation, the newly
  created object must be accessed by name, it is not the target of the
  generic metric, since it is not yet a proper metric.</P>
  <P>A package for General Relativity is included in REDTEN (described in
  Chapter <A href="node33.html#gr">4</A>), and allows the user to enter a
  metric directly from the line-element:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class=
"c1">#: <I>ds2 := d(t)^2-rt^2*(d(om)^2+s^2*(d(th)^2+sin(th)^2*d(ph)^2));</I>

                 2     2        2                2        2   2
 ds2 := ( - d(om)  k rt  - d(ph)  sin(sqrt(k) om)  sin(th)  rt

                2          2                2   2
          + d(t)  k - d(th)  sin(sqrt(k) om)  rt )/k

#: <I>metric (ds2);</I>

 computing g1
 invert finished.

 g1
</SPAN></PRE>In this case, the metric name is defined by the system. It will
have the form <SPAN class="c1">g&lt;sequence number&gt;</SPAN>, where
<SPAN class="c1">&lt;sequence number&gt;</SPAN> is <A name="770" id=
"770"></A> initially 1, and increments for every new metric that is created
in this fashion. An optional second argument allows the user to specify the
name that will be used instead for the metric. This method is more convenient
for simple metrics that are ordinarily presented in the form of a
line-element, while the first method is often useful for very complicated
metrics that are too troublesome to express in line-element form.
  <P>The line-element is written as a REDUCE expression containing the
  differential operator d(). This operator computes the total derivative of
  its argument with respect to the current coordinates; if the argument is
  one of the coordinate names, d() returns unevaluated. By examining the
  expression for d() operators the system can determine the structure of the
  metric, and can also tell if the metric is diagonal or simply
  symmetric.</P>
  <P>metric()</P>
  <P>Once the elements of the metric are in place, one needs a way to examine
  the object to ensure all is well.</P>
