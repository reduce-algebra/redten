<P>
<A NAME=sseccomp>&#160;</A>    To make use of this metric we must first set the correct coordinates
as above, and then create an appropriate indexed object and enter
values for its components. Since this is a metric tensor, it will have
two covariant tensor indices, and will be symmetric:
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>mkobj ('h, '(-1 -1), '((1 1 2)), '(), 'metric);</i>

 h
  a b

#: <i>depend rt, t;</i>

#: <i>let s = sin(sqrt(k)*om)/sqrt(k);</i>
</tt></PRE>Notice that we have set up the object so that the itype is <tt>metric</tt>, and have used an empty list for the undesired implicit
parameter. It is common to use the name g for a metric, but in
REDTEN it has been made into a ``<b>generic</b>'' (qv) name, and
should not be disturbed; we shall use <tt>h</tt> in this example
instead. We have also set up the time-dependence of <tt>rt</tt> (using
<tt>rt</tt> instead of
R, since <tt>R</tt> is generic too) and defined a <tt>let</tt> rule to 
evaluate <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_10787_tex2html_wrap6244.gif">. This last part could be done as easily with a REDUCE
assignment.
<P>
There are two ways to enter the values of the components of <tt>h</tt>.
The first method involves the expected assignment operation, where
the left-hand side, referring to a specific element with a fixed
index, is assigned the value on the right hand side. Unlike the normal
REDUCE assignment operation which uses the symbol <tt>:=</tt>, the 
<A NAME=689>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=690>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=691>&#160;</A>
REDTEN indexed assignment operation uses the symbol <tt>==</tt>. Attempting to
assign a value to an indexed object element with the <tt>:=</tt> operator
will result in a REDUCE <tt>Missing Operator</tt> error
mclear()
message<A NAME=tex2html64 HREF="footnode.html#4113"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.gif"></A>.
We can proceed as follows:
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>h[0,0] == 1;</i>

   1

#: <i>h[1,1] == -rt^2;</i>

      2
   -rt

#: <i>h[2,2] == -s^2*rt^2;</i>

                    2   2
   - sin(sqrt(k) om)  rt
 -------------------------
             k

#: <i>h[3,3] == -sin(th)^2*s^2*rt^2;</i>

                    2        2   2
   - sin(sqrt(k) om)  sin(th)  rt
 ----------------------------------
                 k

</tt></PRE>As each value is entered, the system then reads the object to determine the
actual value stored for that component, since it is possible for the
assignment to fail due to symmetries or write-protection of the
object. These are explicit components for <tt>h</tt>, and since <tt>h</tt>
was not declared as an ``implicit'' object, any missing components are
taken as 0. If any component already had a non-zero value, that value
is overwritten (unless the object is write-protected).
<P>
When  a large number of elements are to be assigned to the same
object, a more convenient method is to use the function ias(). This
function takes an indexed object as input and guides the user through
the assignment process. At its simplest, ias() attempts to
assign to the whole object, keeping in mind the intrinsic symmetries
that are present. The user may also attach an index that indicates the
assignments are to be to a particular row or column of the object.
Using ias() the assignment to <tt>h</tt> would proceed as follows:
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>ias(h);</i>
  h[0,0] = <i>1;</i>
  h[0,1] = <i>;</i>
  h[0,2] = <i>;</i>
  h[0,3] = <i>;</i>
  h[1,1] = <i>-rt^2;</i>
  h[1,2] = <i>;</i>
  h[1,3] = <i>;</i>
  h[2,2] = <i>-s^2*rt^2;</i>
  h[2,3] = <i>;</i>
  h[3,3] = <i>-sin(th)^2*s^2*rt^2;</i>

  h
</tt></PRE>At each prompt the user may enter the desired value; a semi-colon
alone is equivalent to zero. If the user types <tt>nil</tt><A NAME=tex2html65 HREF="footnode.html#4120"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.gif"></A>
then the assignment process is terminated, and any remaining
unassigned components will be unchanged.
<P>
The function iclear() can be used to remove all of the components
of several indexed objects (and the multiplier), without disturbing
any of the other properties.
<P>

<P>
So far we have created only a rank-2 object with some symmetries and
values, the rest of the structure associated with a metric is not yet
present. The function metric() is used to fully qualify an object
as a metric: it attaches the required properties, adjusts some system
variables and creates the metric inverse. We may apply metric() to
<tt>h</tt> very simply:
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>metric(h);</i>

 invert finished.

 h
</tt></PRE>At the end of this process <tt>h</tt> has been declared the
``current-metric'', and its name is installed in the system variable
currentmetric.
Among other things, this means that <tt>h</tt> will be used by
shift() when raising or lowering tensor indices. The generic metric 
<A NAME=745>&#160;</A>
g will also refer to this object (see <A HREF="node38.html#secgenerics">4.3</A>).
The metric inverse will be given the name <tt>h_inv</tt>, it is created
from the metric by the matrix function invert() (qv).
<A NAME=750>&#160;</A>
The indexed object passed to metric() must be a rank-2 covariant
object, and is assumed to be symmetric. If it is actually diagonal (as
this example is), the symmetry will be adjusted to reflect this. A
diagonal symmetry helps the system to run faster for many operations
involving the metric, particularly in the raising and lowering of
indices with shift().
<P>
metric() can also be used to create a new indexed object suitable
for filling with metric coefficients. To do this, give metric()
no arguments, the object it creates will have a name in the usual
sequence of metric objects described below. After the user has
entered the metric coefficients, metric() should be called again
as demonstrated above to finish the job of setting up the metric. In
this situation, the newly created object must be accessed by name, it
is not the target of the generic metric, since it is not yet a proper
metric.
<P>
A package for General Relativity is included in REDTEN (described
in Chapter <A HREF="node33.html#gr">4</A>), and allows
the user to enter a metric directly from the line-element:
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>ds2 := d(t)^2-rt^2*(d(om)^2+s^2*(d(th)^2+sin(th)^2*d(ph)^2));</i>

                 2     2        2                2        2   2
 ds2 := ( - d(om)  k rt  - d(ph)  sin(sqrt(k) om)  sin(th)  rt

                2          2                2   2
          + d(t)  k - d(th)  sin(sqrt(k) om)  rt )/k

#: <i>metric (ds2);</i>

 computing g1
 invert finished.

 g1
</tt></PRE>In this case, the metric name is defined by the system. It will have
the form <tt>g&lt;sequence number&gt;</tt>, where <tt>&lt;sequence number&gt;</tt> is
<A NAME=770>&#160;</A>
initially 1, and increments for every new metric that is created in
this fashion. An optional second argument allows the user to specify
the name that will be used instead for the metric.  This method is more
convenient for simple metrics that are ordinarily presented in the
form of a line-element, while the first method is often useful for very
complicated metrics that are too troublesome to express in
line-element form.
<P>
The line-element is written as a REDUCE expression containing the
differential operator d(). This operator computes the total
derivative of its argument with respect to the current coordinates; if
the argument is one of the coordinate names, d() returns
unevaluated. By examining the expression for d() operators the
system can determine the structure of the metric, and can also tell if
the metric is diagonal or simply symmetric.
<P>
metric()
<P>
Once the elements of the metric are in place, one needs a way to
examine the object to ensure all is well.
