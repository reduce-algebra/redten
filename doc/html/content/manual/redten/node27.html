      <a name="sseccomp" id="sseccomp"></a> To make use of this metric we must
      first set the correct coordinates as above, and then create an appropriate
      indexed object and enter values for its components. Since this is a metric
      tensor, it will have two covariant tensor indices, and will be symmetric:
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>mkobj ('h, '(-1 -1), '((1 1 2)), '(), 'metric);</I>

 h
  a b

#: <I>depend rt, t;</I>

#: <I>let s = sin(sqrt(k)*om)/sqrt(k);</I>
</SPAN></PRE>
    Notice that we have set up the object so that the itype is
    <span class="c1">metric</span>, and have used an empty list for the
    undesired implicit parameter. It is common to use the name g for a metric,
    but in REDTEN it has been made into a ``<b>generic</b>'' (qv) name, and
    should not be disturbed; we shall use <span class="c1">h</span> in this
    example instead. We have also set up the time-dependence of
    <span class="c1">rt</span> (using <span class="c1">rt</span> instead of R,
    since <span class="c1">R</span> is generic too) and defined a
    <span class="c1">let</span> rule to evaluate
    <img align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6244.png" />. This last part
    could be done as easily with a REDUCE assignment.
    <p>
      There are two ways to enter the values of the components of
      <span class="c1">h</span>. The first method involves the expected
      assignment operation, where the left-hand side, referring to a specific
      element with a fixed index, is assigned the value on the right hand side.
      Unlike the normal REDUCE assignment operation which uses the symbol
      <span class="c1">:=</span>, the <a name="689" id="689"></a>
      <a name="690" id="690"></a> <a name="691" id="691"></a> REDTEN indexed
      assignment operation uses the symbol <span class="c1">==</span>.
      Attempting to assign a value to an indexed object element with the
      <span class="c1">:=</span> operator will result in a REDUCE
      <span class="c1">Missing Operator</span> error mclear() message<a
        name="tex2html64"
        href="footnode.html#4113"

          alt='.png"'
          src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png" /></a
      >. We can proceed as follows:
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>h[0,0] == 1;</I>

   1

#: <I>h[1,1] == -rt^2;</I>

      2
   -rt

#: <I>h[2,2] == -s^2*rt^2;</I>

                    2   2
   - sin(sqrt(k) om)  rt
 -------------------------
             k

#: <I>h[3,3] == -sin(th)^2*s^2*rt^2;</I>

                    2        2   2
   - sin(sqrt(k) om)  sin(th)  rt
 ----------------------------------
                 k

</SPAN></PRE>
    As each value is entered, the system then reads the object to determine the
    actual value stored for that component, since it is possible for the
    assignment to fail due to symmetries or write-protection of the object.
    These are explicit components for <span class="c1">h</span>, and since
    <span class="c1">h</span> was not declared as an ``implicit'' object, any
    missing components are taken as 0. If any component already had a non-zero
    value, that value is overwritten (unless the object is write-protected).
    <p>
      When a large number of elements are to be assigned to the same object, a
      more convenient method is to use the function ias(). This function takes
      an indexed object as input and guides the user through the assignment
      process. At its simplest, ias() attempts to assign to the whole object,
      keeping in mind the intrinsic symmetries that are present. The user may
      also attach an index that indicates the assignments are to be to a
      particular row or column of the object. Using ias() the assignment to
      <span class="c1">h</span> would proceed as follows:
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>ias(h);</I>
  h[0,0] = <I>1;</I>
  h[0,1] = <I>;</I>
  h[0,2] = <I>;</I>
  h[0,3] = <I>;</I>
  h[1,1] = <I>-rt^2;</I>
  h[1,2] = <I>;</I>
  h[1,3] = <I>;</I>
  h[2,2] = <I>-s^2*rt^2;</I>
  h[2,3] = <I>;</I>
  h[3,3] = <I>-sin(th)^2*s^2*rt^2;</I>

  h
</SPAN></PRE>
    At each prompt the user may enter the desired value; a semi-colon alone is
    equivalent to zero. If the user types <span class="c1">nil</span
    ><a name="tex2html65" href="footnode.html#4120" id="tex2html65"
      ><img
        align="bottom"
        alt='.png"'
        src="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"
    /></a>
    then the assignment process is terminated, and any remaining unassigned
    components will be unchanged.
    <p>
      The function iclear() can be used to remove all of the components of
      several indexed objects (and the multiplier), without disturbing any of
      the other properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far we have created only a rank-2 object with some symmetries and
      values, the rest of the structure associated with a metric is not yet
      present. The function metric() is used to fully qualify an object as a
      metric: it attaches the required properties, adjusts some system variables
      and creates the metric inverse. We may apply metric() to
      <span class="c1">h</span> very simply:
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>metric(h);</I>

 invert finished.

 h
</SPAN></PRE>
    At the end of this process <span class="c1">h</span> has been declared the
    ``current-metric'', and its name is installed in the system variable
    currentmetric. Among other things, this means that
    <span class="c1"> h</span> will be used by shift() when raising or lowering
    tensor indices. The generic metric <a name="745" id="745"></a> g will also
    refer to this object (see <a href="node38.html#secgenerics">4.3</a>). The
    metric inverse will be given the name <span class="c1">h_inv</span>, it is
    created from the metric by the matrix function invert() (qv).
    <a name="750" id="750"></a> The indexed object passed to metric() must be a
    rank-2 covariant object, and is assumed to be symmetric. If it is actually
    diagonal (as this example is), the symmetry will be adjusted to reflect
    this. A diagonal symmetry helps the system to run faster for many operations
    involving the metric, particularly in the raising and lowering of indices
    with shift().
    <p>
      metric() can also be used to create a new indexed object suitable for
      filling with metric coefficients. To do this, give metric() no arguments,
      the object it creates will have a name in the usual sequence of metric
      objects described below. After the user has entered the metric
      coefficients, metric() should be called again as demonstrated above to
      finish the job of setting up the metric. In this situation, the newly
      created object must be accessed by name, it is not the target of the
      generic metric, since it is not yet a proper metric.
    </p>
    <p>
      A package for General Relativity is included in REDTEN (described in
      Chapter <a href="node33.html#gr">4</a>), and allows the user to enter a
      metric directly from the line-element:
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class=
"c1">#: <I>ds2 := d(t)^2-rt^2*(d(om)^2+s^2*(d(th)^2+sin(th)^2*d(ph)^2));</I>

                 2     2        2                2        2   2
 ds2 := ( - d(om)  k rt  - d(ph)  sin(sqrt(k) om)  sin(th)  rt

                2          2                2   2
          + d(t)  k - d(th)  sin(sqrt(k) om)  rt )/k

#: <I>metric (ds2);</I>

 computing g1
 invert finished.

 g1
</SPAN></PRE>
    In this case, the metric name is defined by the system. It will have the
    form <span class="c1">g&lt;sequence number&gt;</span>, where
    <span class="c1">&lt;sequence number&gt;</span> is
    <a name="770" id="770"></a> initially 1, and increments for every new metric
    that is created in this fashion. An optional second argument allows the user
    to specify the name that will be used instead for the metric. This method is
    more convenient for simple metrics that are ordinarily presented in the form
    of a line-element, while the first method is often useful for very
    complicated metrics that are too troublesome to express in line-element
    form.
    <p>
      The line-element is written as a REDUCE expression containing the
      differential operator d(). This operator computes the total derivative of
      its argument with respect to the current coordinates; if the argument is
      one of the coordinate names, d() returns unevaluated. By examining the
      expression for d() operators the system can determine the structure of the
      metric, and can also tell if the metric is diagonal or simply symmetric.
    </p>
    <p>metric()</p>
    <p>
      Once the elements of the metric are in place, one needs a way to examine
      the object to ensure all is well.
