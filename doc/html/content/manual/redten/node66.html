  <P><A name="starting" id="starting"></A> Since REDTEN is a large package
  layered onto REDUCE, the first prerequisite to running REDTEN is to have a
  computer that can successfully run REDUCE, and to obtain REDUCE
  itself<A name="tex2html110" href="footnode.html#4212" id=
  "tex2html110"><IMG align="bottom" alt=".png&quot;" src=
  "../../../images/latex/foot_motif.png"></A>. The range of machines which
  can be used is now very large, from relatively small 286's to large
  super-minis and mainframes. In all cases, at least 4 Megabytes of RAM are
  recomended if any reasonable amount of work is to be done. With the
  ever-decreasing cost of memory, this requirement is no longer particularly
  difficult or expensive to meet.</P>
  <P>The REDTEN distribution comes as a compressed tar file of a little more
  than 500 Kbytes. It uncompresses to about 1.4 Mbytes. One needs twice this
  amount of disk space to hold the tar file and the extracted sources. The
  size of the compiled REDTEN varies depeding on the lisp system used, but
  can be a few hundred Kbytes.</P>
  <P>Assuming that a REDUCE package has been obtained for a particular
  machine, bringing up REDTEN is a straightforward process of compiling the
  source modules together into a loadable file. The user should make note of
  the following information:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>The REDUCE version; currently versions 3.5, 3.4 (and subversions
    thereof) and version 3.3 are supported. Support for REDUCE version 3.2
    has fallen off.</LI>
    <LI>The kind of lisp system used to support REDUCE. REDTEN has been
    compiled in PSL, CSL, Culisp. Other lisp bases for REDUCE may require
    some minor amount of adjustment to REDTEN before it will run correctly
    (see below). Ask your system manager if you do not know which lisp is
    used.</LI>
    <LI>The default case of the base system. This should be evident after
    using REDUCE once: if input typed in lower case is reprinted in upper
    case, the base system is upper case.</LI>
  </UL>
  <P>This information is used to set up the following files in the REDTEN
  source directory (see also the file <SPAN class="c1">README</SPAN> in the
  source directory).</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>In the <SPAN class="c1">src</SPAN> directory there are some local
    files: <SPAN class="c1">local3?.red</SPAN>. Each of these contains the
    redefinitions of some REDUCE functions for a particular version of
    REDUCE. The appropriate file must be linked or copied to <SPAN class=
    "c1">local.red</SPAN>, which is the file that is loaded with the rest of
    the REDTEN system.</LI>
    <LI>There are also some decl files: <SPAN class="c1">decl3?.red</SPAN>.
    If your REDUCE version is 3.2 or 3.3, copy or link <SPAN class=
    "c1">decl33.red</SPAN> to <SPAN class="c1">decl.red</SPAN>; if the
    version is 3.4 or higher copy <SPAN class="c1">decl34.red</SPAN>.</LI>
    <LI>If the base case of your REDUCE is upper, copy (or link) the file
    <SPAN class="c1">bcaseup.red</SPAN> to <SPAN class=
    "c1">basecase.red</SPAN>, otherwise copy <SPAN class=
    "c1">bcasedn.red</SPAN> to <SPAN class="c1">basecase.red</SPAN>.</LI>
    <LI>REDTEN makes use of two functions that are not part of Standard Lisp,
    but which are included in every reasonable lisp. In PSL these functions
    are named prop() and unboundp(). Other lisps may use different names. The
    <SPAN class="c1">src/sysfn</SPAN> sub-directory contains files for the
    definition of these functions for other lisps. Copy or link the
    appropriate system file into the source directory under the name
    <SPAN class="c1">sysfn.red</SPAN>. For example, for csl lisp copy
    <SPAN class="c1">src/sysfn/csl.red</SPAN> to <SPAN class=
    "c1">src/sysfn.red</SPAN>.</LI>
  </UL>
  <P>Under a UNIX system (or one that is capable of running shell scripts),
  the shell script <SPAN class="c1">setup</SPAN> in the root directory of the
  distribution will determine the above information and set-up the first
  three system files correctly. This script assumes a link to the REDUCE
  executable has been made in the root directory of the REDTEN distribution.
  The determination of the lisp type and the copying of <SPAN class=
  "c1">sysfn.red</SPAN> is up to the user.</P>
  <P>Finally, REDTEN makes use of a control sequence to move the cursor up a
  line on the screen, this is stored as a list on the variable upcursor!*.
  The default value is set near the top of the <SPAN class=
  "c1">sys.env</SPAN> file, and is appropriate to a VT100 terminal or
  similar. If different kind of display screen is used, the correct control
  sequence can be defined here (the list consists of literal control
  character and strings). The control variable can also be set from the users
  environment via the UPCUROSR environment variable. This is still a bit
  flakey.</P>
  <P>Once the source files are properly set the user must define the
  <SPAN class="c1">redten</SPAN> environment variable. Under DOS try</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">set redten=&lt;path to root of REDTEN distribution&gt;
</SPAN></PRE>and under UNIX (and csh) type
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">setenv redten &lt;path to root of REDTEN distribution&gt;
</SPAN></PRE>You are now ready to compile REDTEN. The exact details vary
depending on the underlying lisp system. For PSL and similar lisps, move in
to the <SPAN class="c1">fasl</SPAN> directory and start REDUCE. Type the
following:
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>in "$redten/src/redten.gen"$</I>
</SPAN></PRE>This will start the REDUCE compiler, load all the source files,
and leave a file called <SPAN class="c1">redten.b</SPAN> in the current
directory. The process may take several minutes to complete, and REDUCE will
exit at the end of it.
  <P>For lisps like CSL, the same commands apply, but a separate compiled
  <SPAN class="c1">redten.b</SPAN> file is not produced, rather the compiled
  code is added to the REDUCE ``image'', and can be loaded on demand. You may
  need special privileges in order to modify the REDUCE image.</P>
  <P>If REDUCE fails to compile the entire set of sources in one go (exiting
  with a ``Heap space exhausted'' message), then REDTEN will need to be
  compiled one source file at a time. This can be done as above by using the
  file <SPAN class="c1">redten1.gen</SPAN> instead of <SPAN class=
  "c1">redten.gen</SPAN>. If this is done, you must also set the <SPAN class=
  "c1">redten</SPAN> environment variable each time you want to run
  REDTEN.</P>
  <P>To use REDTEN, first start REDUCE, then load the compiled REDTEN code.
  In PSL this is done with the <SPAN class="c1">load()</SPAN> function:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>load "redten";</I>

 "Reduce-tensor, Version v4.0, Wed Nov 16 13:49:23 EST 1994
"$
</SPAN></PRE>while in CSL the equivalent command is called <SPAN class="c1">
  load!-module()</SPAN>.
  <P>After REDTEN is loaded for the first time, it should be tested with some
  of the examples found in the <SPAN class="c1">demo</SPAN> directory. Simply
  use the REDUCE in() command to input any of the demo files.</P>
