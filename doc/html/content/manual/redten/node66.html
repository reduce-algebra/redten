      >. The range of machines which can be used is now very large, from
      relatively small 286's to large super-minis and mainframes. In all cases,
      at least 4 Megabytes of RAM are recomended if any reasonable amount of
      work is to be done. With the ever-decreasing cost of memory, this
      requirement is no longer particularly difficult or expensive to meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The REDTEN distribution comes as a compressed tar file of a little more
      than 500 Kbytes. It uncompresses to about 1.4 Mbytes. One needs twice this
      amount of disk space to hold the tar file and the extracted sources. The
      size of the compiled REDTEN varies depeding on the lisp system used, but
      can be a few hundred Kbytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming that a REDUCE package has been obtained for a particular machine,
      bringing up REDTEN is a straightforward process of compiling the source
      modules together into a loadable file. The user should make note of the
      following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The REDUCE version; currently versions 3.5, 3.4 (and subversions
        thereof) and version 3.3 are supported. Support for REDUCE version 3.2
        has fallen off.
      </li>
      <li>
        The kind of lisp system used to support REDUCE. REDTEN has been compiled
        in PSL, CSL, Culisp. Other lisp bases for REDUCE may require some minor
        amount of adjustment to REDTEN before it will run correctly (see below).
        Ask your system manager if you do not know which lisp is used.
      </li>
      <li>
        The default case of the base system. This should be evident after using
        REDUCE once: if input typed in lower case is reprinted in upper case,
        the base system is upper case.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is used to set up the following files in the REDTEN
      source directory (see also the file <span class="c1">README</span> in the
      source directory).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the <span class="c1">src</span> directory there are some local files:
        <span class="c1">local3?.red</span>. Each of these contains the
        redefinitions of some REDUCE functions for a particular version of
        REDUCE. The appropriate file must be linked or copied to
        <span class="c1">local.red</span>, which is the file that is loaded with
        the rest of the REDTEN system.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are also some decl files: <span class="c1">decl3?.red</span>. If
        your REDUCE version is 3.2 or 3.3, copy or link
        <span class="c1">decl33.red</span> to <span class="c1">decl.red</span>;
        if the version is 3.4 or higher copy <span class="c1">decl34.red</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the base case of your REDUCE is upper, copy (or link) the file
        <span class="c1">bcaseup.red</span> to
        <span class="c1">basecase.red</span>, otherwise copy
        <span class="c1">bcasedn.red</span> to
        <span class="c1">basecase.red</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        REDTEN makes use of two functions that are not part of Standard Lisp,
        but which are included in every reasonable lisp. In PSL these functions
        are named prop() and unboundp(). Other lisps may use different names.
        The <span class="c1">src/sysfn</span> sub-directory contains files for
        the definition of these functions for other lisps. Copy or link the
        appropriate system file into the source directory under the name
        <span class="c1">sysfn.red</span>. For example, for csl lisp copy
        <span class="c1">src/sysfn/csl.red</span> to
        <span class="c1">src/sysfn.red</span>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Under a UNIX system (or one that is capable of running shell scripts), the
      shell script <span class="c1">setup</span> in the root directory of the
      distribution will determine the above information and set-up the first
      three system files correctly. This script assumes a link to the REDUCE
      executable has been made in the root directory of the REDTEN distribution.
      The determination of the lisp type and the copying of
      <span class="c1">sysfn.red</span> is up to the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, REDTEN makes use of a control sequence to move the cursor up a
      line on the screen, this is stored as a list on the variable upcursor!*.
      The default value is set near the top of the
      <span class="c1">sys.env</span> file, and is appropriate to a VT100
      terminal or similar. If different kind of display screen is used, the
      correct control sequence can be defined here (the list consists of literal
      control character and strings). The control variable can also be set from
      the users environment via the UPCUROSR environment variable. This is still
      a bit flakey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the source files are properly set the user must define the
      <span class="c1">redten</span> environment variable. Under DOS try
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">set redten=&lt;path to root of REDTEN distribution&gt;
</SPAN></PRE>
    and under UNIX (and csh) type
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">setenv redten &lt;path to root of REDTEN distribution&gt;
</SPAN></PRE>
    You are now ready to compile REDTEN. The exact details vary depending on the
    underlying lisp system. For PSL and similar lisps, move in to the
    <span class="c1">fasl</span> directory and start REDUCE. Type the following:
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>in "$redten/src/redten.gen"$</I>
</SPAN></PRE>
    This will start the REDUCE compiler, load all the source files, and leave a
    file called <span class="c1">redten.b</span> in the current directory. The
    process may take several minutes to complete, and REDUCE will exit at the
    end of it.
    <p>
      For lisps like CSL, the same commands apply, but a separate compiled
      <span class="c1">redten.b</span> file is not produced, rather the compiled
      code is added to the REDUCE ``image'', and can be loaded on demand. You
      may need special privileges in order to modify the REDUCE image.
    </p>
    <p>
      If REDUCE fails to compile the entire set of sources in one go (exiting
      with a ``Heap space exhausted'' message), then REDTEN will need to be
      compiled one source file at a time. This can be done as above by using the
      file <span class="c1">redten1.gen</span> instead of
      <span class="c1">redten.gen</span>. If this is done, you must also set the
      <span class="c1">redten</span> environment variable each time you want to
      run REDTEN.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use REDTEN, first start REDUCE, then load the compiled REDTEN code. In
      PSL this is done with the <span class="c1">load()</span> function:
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>load "redten";</I>

 "Reduce-tensor, Version v4.0, Wed Nov 16 13:49:23 EST 1994
"$
</SPAN></PRE>
    while in CSL the equivalent command is called
    <span class="c1"> load!-module()</span>.
    <p>
      After REDTEN is loaded for the first time, it should be tested with some
      of the examples found in the <span class="c1">demo</span> directory.
      Simply use the REDUCE in() command to input any of the demo files.
