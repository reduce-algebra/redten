<A NAME=starting>&#160;</A>   
Since REDTEN is a large package layered onto REDUCE, the first
prerequisite to running REDTEN is to have a computer that can
successfully run REDUCE, and to obtain REDUCE
itself<A NAME=tex2html110 HREF="footnode.html#4212"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="../../../images/latex/foot_motif.gif"></A>. The range of machines which
can be used is now very large, from relatively small 286's to large
super-minis and mainframes. In all cases, at least 4 Megabytes of RAM
are recomended if any reasonable amount of work is to be done. With
the ever-decreasing cost of memory, this requirement is no longer
particularly difficult or expensive to meet.
<P>
The REDTEN distribution comes as a compressed tar file of a little
more than 500 Kbytes. It uncompresses to about 1.4 Mbytes. One needs
twice this amount of disk space to hold the tar file and the extracted
sources. The size of the compiled REDTEN varies depeding on the
lisp system used, but can be a few hundred Kbytes.
<P>
Assuming that a REDUCE package has been obtained for a particular
machine, bringing up REDTEN is a straightforward process of
compiling the source modules together into a loadable file. The user
should make note of the following information:
<UL><LI> The REDUCE version; currently versions 3.5, 3.4 (and
subversions 
thereof) and version 3.3 are supported. Support for REDUCE version
3.2 has fallen off.
<LI> The kind of lisp system used to support REDUCE. REDTEN has
been compiled in PSL, CSL, Culisp. Other lisp bases for REDUCE may
require some minor amount of adjustment to REDTEN before it will
run correctly (see below). Ask your system manager if you do not know
which lisp is used.
<LI> The default case of the base system. This should be evident
after using REDUCE once: if input typed in lower case is reprinted
in upper case, the base system is upper case.
</UL>
<P>
This information is used to set up the following files in the
REDTEN source directory (see also the file <tt>README</tt> in the
source directory).
<P>
<UL><LI> In the <tt>src</tt> directory there are some local files: <tt>local3?.red</tt>. Each of these
contains the redefinitions of some REDUCE functions for a
particular version of REDUCE. The appropriate file must be linked
or copied to <tt>local.red</tt>, which is the file that is loaded with
the rest of the REDTEN system.
<LI> There are also some decl files: <tt>decl3?.red</tt>.
If your REDUCE version is 3.2 or 3.3, copy or link
<tt>decl33.red</tt> to <tt>decl.red</tt>; if the version is 3.4 or higher
copy <tt>decl34.red</tt>. 
<LI> If the base case of your REDUCE is upper, copy (or link) the
file <tt>bcaseup.red</tt> to <tt>basecase.red</tt>, otherwise copy <tt>bcasedn.red</tt> to <tt>basecase.red</tt>.
<LI> REDTEN makes use of two functions that are not part of
Standard Lisp, but which are included in every reasonable lisp. In PSL
these functions are named prop() and unboundp(). Other
lisps may use different names. The <tt>src/sysfn</tt> sub-directory
contains files for the definition of these functions for other
lisps. Copy or link the appropriate system file into the source
directory under the name <tt>sysfn.red</tt>. For example, for csl lisp
copy <tt>src/sysfn/csl.red</tt> to <tt>src/sysfn.red</tt>.
</UL>
<P>
Under a UNIX system (or one that is capable of running shell scripts),
the shell script <tt>setup</tt> in the root directory of the distribution
will determine the above information and set-up the first three system
files correctly. This script assumes a link to the REDUCE
executable has been made in the root directory of the REDTEN
distribution. The determination of the lisp type and the copying of
<tt>sysfn.red</tt> is up to the user.
<P>
Finally, REDTEN makes use of a control sequence to move the cursor
up a line on the screen, this is stored as a list on the variable
upcursor!*. The default value is set near the top of the <tt>sys.env</tt> file, and is appropriate to a VT100 terminal or similar. If
different kind of display screen is used, the correct control sequence
can be defined here (the list consists of literal control character
and strings). The control variable can also be set from the users
environment via the UPCUROSR environment variable. This is still a bit
flakey.
<P>
Once the source files are properly set the user must define the <tt>redten</tt> environment variable. Under DOS try
<PRE> 
<tt>set redten=&lt;path to root of REDTEN distribution&gt;
</tt></PRE>and under UNIX (and csh) type
<PRE> 
<tt>setenv redten &lt;path to root of REDTEN distribution&gt;
</tt></PRE>You are now ready to compile REDTEN. The exact details vary
depending on the underlying lisp system. For PSL and similar lisps,
move in to the <tt>fasl</tt> directory and start REDUCE. Type the following:
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>in &quot;$redten/src/redten.gen&quot;$</i>
</tt></PRE>This will start the REDUCE compiler, load all the source files, and
leave a file called <tt>redten.b</tt> in the current directory. The
process may take several minutes to complete, and REDUCE will exit
at the end of it.
<P>
For lisps like CSL, the same commands apply, but a separate compiled
<tt>redten.b</tt> file is not produced, rather the compiled code is added
to the REDUCE ``image'', and can be loaded on demand. You may need
special privileges in order to modify the REDUCE image.
<P>
If REDUCE fails to compile the entire set of sources in one go
(exiting with a ``Heap space exhausted'' message), then REDTEN will
need to be compiled one source file at a time. This can be done as
above by using the file <tt>redten1.gen</tt> instead of <tt>redten.gen</tt>.
If this is done, you must also set the <tt>redten</tt> environment
variable each time you want to run REDTEN.
<P>
To use REDTEN, first start REDUCE, then load the compiled
REDTEN code. In PSL this is done with the <tt>load()</tt> function:
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>load &quot;redten&quot;;</i>

 &quot;Reduce-tensor, Version v4.0, Wed Nov 16 13:49:23 EST 1994
&quot;$
</tt></PRE>while in CSL the equivalent command is called <tt>load!-module()</tt>.
<P>
After REDTEN is loaded for the first time, it should be tested with
some of the examples found in the <tt>demo</tt> directory. Simply use the
REDUCE in() command to input any of the demo files.
