    <p>
      <a name="secotherutil" id="secotherutil"></a> There are several functions
      in REDTEN whose intention is to make the usage of the system more
      convenient for the user. Of these functions, dir() has been previously
      introduced. The function dir() displays the indexed objects in the system,
      showing the full name of the object, its type and number of explicit
      elements (components), the protection flags, the coordinates and the index
      structure. For example, after the Ricci tensor of the Kerr metric is
      simplified, a directory shows the following:
      <a name="direg" id="direg"></a>
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>dir(!*);</I>
  name          type          comp    prot  coordinates     indextype

</SPAN></PRE>
    Notice that the Ricci tensor has no components, as it should for a vacuum
    solution. The current metric and its inverse are flagged by a leading
    <span class="c1">*</span> on the display line. Objects that are implicit
    have a <span class="c1">+</span> symbol following the number of components
    to indicate that there are more values than are explicitly stored. Ordinary
    derivatives (which are not normally displayed, see ยง<a
      href="node34.html#secodf"
      >4.1</a
    >) may have a <span class="c1">?</span> following the number of components
    to indicate that there are undefined components. Objects that are
    write-protected will have a <span class="c1">W</span> in the protection
    column, if they are kill-protected there will be a
    <span class="c1">K</span>, and if they are write- and kill-protected then
    there will be a <span class="c1">KW</span>. If there are no objects in the
    system, the message <span class="c1">no objects</span> is displayed.
    <p>
      With no arguments dir() shows all objects in order of creation, any
      arguments are taken as the names of objects to display alone. If the
      switch reversedir is turned off, the display proceeds in the reverse
      order, with the most recently created objects displayed first. The
      function nodir() flags objects so that they do not appear in a directory
      listing, the flag can be cleared by calling dir() with the object name as
      an argument. Some objects created by the system, such as the
      delta-functions, are hidden from dir() and are never displayed.
      <a name="4149" id="4149"></a> <a name="4150" id="4150"></a> If the keyword
      <span class="c1">all</span> is the single argument to dir(), then all
      objects are displayed regardless of the nodir flags. Scalar objects are
      not displayed in line with the other objects, their names are displayed at
      the end of the listing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rudimentary pattern matcher is used by dir() to expand names
      <a name="patterns" id="patterns"></a> containing certain special
      characters. A <span class="c1">!*</span> matches any number of characters
      (including none), while a <span class="c1">!?</span> matches exactly one
      character. Thus, the pattern <span class="c1">!*</span> matches all names
      and is equivalent to the keyword <span class="c1">all</span>. The user can
      display the family of a given object with the pattern
      <span class="c1">&lt;name&gt;!*</span> or find all objects of a certain
      type, such as the Riemann tensor, with <span class="c1">!*R</span>.
      Objects selected in this way are displayed regardless of the nodir flags.
    </p>
    <p>
      For metrics, the setmetric() function uses nodir() to hide the metric that
      was previously the current-metric, dir() will not display that metric or
      any of its family until it is again the current-metric or it appears as an
      explicit argument to dir(). This is intended to keep the directory listing
      short and concise, rather than being cluttered by objects that are not
      currently in use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">iprop()</span></b
      >Each indexed object carries a large number of properties describing the
      objects' structure and characteristics, these are described in ยง<a
        href="node19.html#sseciobprops"
        >2.2.6</a
      >. The function iprop() will display those properties named in the
      iprop!*!* variable, the defaults are specially marked in ยง<a
        href="node19.html#sseciobprops"
        >2.2.6</a
      >. If the switch iprop is on, then iprop() is called whenever the user has
      requested a display of the object's values.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">rem(), remi()</span></b
      >The rem() functions are used to remove indexed objects from the system,
      deleting all of their properties and values. With rem() the user can
      delete specified objects, remi() deletes objects interactively. Both
      functions will accept the same patterns as dir(), as well as the keyword
      <span class="c1">all</span> which is a synonym for the pattern
      <span class="c1">!*</span>. Once an object is deleted there is no way to
      recover its values, hence the need for the protect() function (qv).
    </p>
    <p>
      To use rem(), the user simply types the names of the objects to delete as
      the arguments, so, for example,
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>rem(c1,c2,R);</I>

  (g2_R g2_c2 g2_c1) 
</SPAN></PRE>
    will remove the Christoffel symbols and the Riemann tensor. Notice that
    generic names were used as arguments to rem() but the correct target objects
    were deleted, as shown by the displayed list of deleted objects. If a name
    that was requested be deleted does not appear in this list, then the object
    is kill-protected and cannot be removed until the protection is cleared with
    protect(). If a name not of an indexed object is included in the arguments
    to rem() it will be ignored.
    <p>
      In the interactive mode, remi() presents each indexed object specified to
      the user an asks if is to be deleted. Valid responses are
      <span class="c1">y</span> to delete and move on to the next object,
      <span class="c1">n</span> to keep the object, <span class="c1">g</span> to
      go on and delete all remaining objects and <span class="c1">q</span> to
      quit out of rem(). Each reponse must be followed by a carriage return; the
      <span class="c1">g</span> response will cause a further query to ensure
      the user really wants to delete everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Removing certain objects causes the rem() functions to remove others as
      well, so as not to leave orphaned objects in the system. Specifically,
      removing a metric also removes its entire family of objects, while
      removing a parent object causes all of its offspring to be removed. If an
      indexed scalar is removed and it had a value, that value is placed as a
      normal algebraic value on the now non-indexed name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">protect()</span></b
      >The function protect() sets or clears an objects' protection flags. The
      only protections available are write-protection, kill-protection, or both.
      The first argument to protect() is the name the object whose protections
      are being modifed, and the second argument sets the new protections (a
      missing second argument is equivalent to <span class="c1">nil</span>). The
      values for the second argument may be one of the following:
    </p>
    <p><img align="bottom" src="_10787_tabular1703.png" /></p>
    <p>
      The protection flags are displayed by dir() and by iprop(), however, the
      output from iprop() will show the internal format of the protection flags,
      which are simply the numbers 2, 3, or 6 for write-protection,
      kill-protection, or both, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">icopy()</span></b
      >icopy() The function icopy() copies its first argument to a new object
      whose name is the second argument. The new objects' name should be unused;
      however, if it is an unprotected indexed object it will be removed, but
      its properties are saved and can be restored by an immediate call to
      restoreobj(). The shift property of the restoreobj() output will no longer
      refer to the offspring of the input, but all other properties are copied
      exactly. A more complete copy is offered by the function copyfam(),
      described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">copyfam(), getfam()</span></b
      >The copyfam() function allows the user to copy an object and its entire
      family (either metric or shifted offspring) to another parent. This
      routine rebuilds the family structures of each member so that they all
      correctly refer to new objects. Usually the family of the first named
      argument is copied to the second argument, but, in the case of a metric,
      the second argument may be omitted and the default is the next metric name
      in the sequence used by metric(). The copied metric is not made the
      current-metric.
    </p>
    <p>
      A family of objects is primarily a relation such that the offspring
      <a name="1724" id="1724"></a> objects are derived in some manner from the
      parent, either by shifting indices, taking derivatives, or more
      complicated relations such as among the tensor metric and various GR
      quantities. In REDTEN a family is defined by the construction of object
      names. A family member has the parent name, a separating underscore
      ``<span class="c1">_</span>'', and some further identifying name. These
      constructions can be carried out repeatedly, yielding a family tree of
      related objects. For example, in the dir() listing on page
      <a href="node44.html#direg"
        ><img
          align="bottom"
          alt='.png"'
          src="../../../images/latex/cross_ref_motif.png"
      /></a>
      one can see that <span class="c1">g1</span> is the parent of many objects,
      while <span class="c1">c1</span> is itself the parent of an object, namely
      <span class="c1">g1_c1_DF</span>. The function getfam() will return a lisp
      list of all objects in the family of its argument, including the parent.
      Thus,
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>getfam('g);</I>

 (g1_inv g1_ric g1_R g1_c1 g1_DF g1_c2 g1_c1_DF g1)

#: <I>getfam('c1);</I>

 (g1_c1_DF g1_c1)
</SPAN></PRE>
    and observe that the argument must be quoted to ensure the command line is
    parsed in symbolic mode. Also note that the argument may be either a generic
    name or the true name.
    <p>
      A common use of copyfam() and getfam() is to copy a metric family and then
      apply a consitent set of substitutions to the family without disturbing
      the original set of objects. For example, if <span class="c1">g1</span> is
      a general spherically symmetric metric with a parameter
      <img align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6324.png" />, and with a
      family of computed objects, then the following will copy the family and
      substitute for <img align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6324.png" />:
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>%create g1 and family</I>

#: <I>copyfam(g1);</I>

 g2

#: <I>lisp foreach x in getfam(g2) do write algebraic mapfi(sub(f=1-2*m/r,x));</I>

 &lt;output&gt;

#: <I>lisp foreach x in getfam(g2) do if get (x, 'itype) eq 'odf then 
        write algebraic mapfi (x);</I>

 &lt;output&gt;
</SPAN></PRE>
    The first foreach can be used to apply a substitution to all objects in the
    family, note the use of the write command to ensure that the mapfi() output
    is seen, and the use of the algebraic command to change mode partway along
    the command line. The second foreach command demonstrates the application of
    mapfi() to a specific class of objects, in this case ordinary derivatives.
    It is also possible to use these constructs with other list generating
    functions or with the indexed!-names list directly, to access all objects in
    the system.
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">describe()</span></b
      >The describe() function is used to retrieve or set a string containing a
      description an object. Most generating functions put a description string
      on their output specifying what kind of object has been created, and from
      what object it was derived. A string supplied as the second argument will
      replace the description on the object whose name is the first argument to
      describe().
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">help()</span></b
      >The REDTEN help() function implements a rudimentary help utility to
      remind the user of the correct number and types of arguments to various
      REDTEN functions. help() takes any number of arguments, which may be
      patterns of the sort described on page
      <a href="node44.html#patterns"
        ><img
          align="bottom"
          alt='.png"'
          src="../../../images/latex/cross_ref_motif.png" /></a
      >; a <span class="c1">!*</span> pattern will show all help strings, while,
      for example, the pattern <span class="c1">!*env</span> will give help for
      all the functions that deal with the REDUCE environment. With no
      arguments, help() prints a list of the names of functions and switches for
      which help is available.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">defindextype()</span></b
      >The defindextype() function allows the user to define new types of
      indices or to modify the range of the pre-defined index-types. See ยง<a
        href="node13.html#mkobjindextype"
        >2.2.2</a
      >
      for a description of the pre-defined index-types and table
      <a href="node13.html#tabindextype">2.1</a> for their properties. The call
      to defindextype() takes the form:
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class=
"c1">defindextype ('range:<I>int-list</I>, index-type-val:<I>int</I>,
{'name:<I>id</I>}, {'format:<I>string</I>}, {'chsymgen:<I>func</I>});
</SPAN></PRE>
    where <span class="c1">range</span> is a list of two ordered non-negative
    integers representing the range of the indices of type
    <span class="c1">index-type-val</span> (the range must consist of
    non-negative numbers
    <img align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6326.png" /> ). For example,
    the default range is <span class="c1">'(0 3)</span> for the tensor indices,
    which have <span class="c1">index-type-val</span> 1. For the pre-defined
    index-types only the range may be changed, other arguments after
    <span class="c1">index-type-val</span> are ignored. For new index-types
    (<span class="c1">index-type-val</span>
    <img align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6328.png" />), the remaining
    arguments are: the name by which the new index-type is to be known (eg.
    tensor, spinor, etc.), the format in which indices are to be printed, and a
    function that will generate a Christoffel symbol for this index-type for use
    by cov().
    <p>
      The <span class="c1">name</span> argument is used by mkobj() to determine
      the indexed property of a new object, different index-types may have the
      same name (such as the spinor or dyad types) so that an apparently mixed
      object will be given a meaningful property. The format is a string which
      must include a '%' mark to indicate the placement of the corresponding
      index element, any other characters are printed literally, so for example,
      the format for the frame indices is ``(%)''. The Christoffel symbol
      generation function is used by cov() to determine the appropriate
      Christoffel symbol to use, some index-types do not have a Christoffel
      symbol, in which case <span class="c1">chsymgen</span> is
      <span class="c1">'nil</span>. In other cases the function is of the form
    </p>
    <pre> 
<SPAN class="c1">'(lambda nil (car christoffel2!* '(nil)))
</SPAN></PRE>
    where <span class="c1">christoffel2!*</span> may be replaced by whatever is
    the correct lisp function. This complicated form is required since the
    function, following the usual convention, has a return value of the form
    <span class="c1">'(name . 1)</span>. It is not really intended that the
    casual user be concerned with this.
    <p>
      defindextype() calls the delta function generator delta() to create or
      modify the system delta functions for the new or updated index-type. If no
      arguments are given, defindextype() prints out the currently defined
      index-types, which are stored in the variable defindextype!*.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">restrict()</span></b
      >The indices property of an indexed object are derived from the range
      parameter to defindextype() and specify the inclusive group range of the
      entire index of the object. The restrict() function allows the user to
      narrow this range, so that indexed references apply to only a part of the
      full range. A new property, restricted, is placed on the indexed object
      that is the first argument to restrict() (the name must be quoted to
      ensure parsing in symbolic mode). The next two arguments are the lower and
      upper bounds of the group range, these are lists of integers. If either of
      these arguments is left out, the default is the original group range
      obtained from the indices property on the object. Leaving both bounds off
      returns the group range to that present when the object was created, but
      the restricted property is not removed, just set to the new values.
    </p>
    <p>
      For most object types, the restricted ranges must be contained within the
      original range. For <span class="c1">array</span> type objects, the user
      can reset the bounds to any desired values. Attempting to access
      components of the object outside the currently defined range, even if they
      are present, will yield 0 from a read or write operation. Indexed
      assignments will apply only to the current range, as will applications of
      mapfi(). The user can therefore work with a restricted section of an
      indexed object, without disturbing the remaining portion of the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">saveobj()</span></b
      >If the user is about to modify an object, the value of that object can be
      saved by a call to saveobj(). If something goes wrong, the object's value
      can be recovered by calling restoreobj(). Only one object at a time can be
      saved, and the system also saves objects during indexed asignments and
      when mapfi() is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><span class="c1">mclear()</span></b
      >The REDTEN hooks in the REDUCE parser in some places make use of global
      variables that control the parsing action. If an error has occured or the
      user has aborted an operation, these variables may be left in an
      inconsistent state. It may then be impossible to correctly enter indexed
      objects and output may be distorted. The function mclear() should always
      be called if the user suspects a parsing problem or has forced an abort.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a directory listing shows objects with names of the form
      <span class="c1">#tmp1</span> etc, then an abort has been made, but
      mclear() still needs to be called. These object are the temporaries used
