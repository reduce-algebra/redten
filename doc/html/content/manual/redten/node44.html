  <P><A name="secotherutil" id="secotherutil"></A> There are several
  functions in REDTEN whose intention is to make the usage of the system more
  convenient for the user. Of these functions, dir() has been previously
  introduced. The function dir() displays the indexed objects in the system,
  showing the full name of the object, its type and number of explicit
  elements (components), the protection flags, the coordinates and the index
  structure. For example, after the Ricci tensor of the Kerr metric is
  simplified, a directory shows the following: <A name="direg" id=
  "direg"></A></P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>dir(!*);</I>

 t

</SPAN></PRE>Notice that the Ricci tensor has no components, as it should for
a vacuum solution. The current metric and its inverse are flagged by a
leading <SPAN class="c1">*</SPAN> on the display line. Objects that are
implicit have a <SPAN class="c1">+</SPAN> symbol following the number of
components to indicate that there are more values than are explicitly stored.
Ordinary derivatives (which are not normally displayed, see ยง<A href=
"node34.html#secodf">4.1</A>) may have a <SPAN class="c1">?</SPAN> following
the number of components to indicate that there are undefined components.
Objects that are write-protected will have a <SPAN class="c1">W</SPAN> in the
protection column, if they are kill-protected there will be a <SPAN class=
"c1">K</SPAN>, and if they are write- and kill-protected then there will be a
<SPAN class="c1">KW</SPAN>. If there are no objects in the system, the
message <SPAN class="c1">no objects</SPAN> is displayed.
  <P>With no arguments dir() shows all objects in order of creation, any
  arguments are taken as the names of objects to display alone. If the switch
  reversedir is turned off, the display proceeds in the reverse order, with
  the most recently created objects displayed first. The function nodir()
  flags objects so that they do not appear in a directory listing, the flag
  can be cleared by calling dir() with the object name as an argument. Some
  objects created by the system, such as the delta-functions, are hidden from
  dir() and are never displayed. <A name="4149" id="4149"></A> <A name="4150"
  id="4150"></A> If the keyword <SPAN class="c1">all</SPAN> is the single
  argument to dir(), then all objects are displayed regardless of the nodir
  flags. Scalar objects are not displayed in line with the other objects,
  their names are displayed at the end of the listing.</P>
  <P>A rudimentary pattern matcher is used by dir() to expand names <A name=
  "patterns" id="patterns"></A> containing certain special characters. A
  <SPAN class="c1">!*</SPAN> matches any number of characters (including
  none), while a <SPAN class="c1">!?</SPAN> matches exactly one character.
  Thus, the pattern <SPAN class="c1">!*</SPAN> matches all names and is
  equivalent to the keyword <SPAN class="c1">all</SPAN>. The user can display
  the family of a given object with the pattern <SPAN class=
  "c1">&lt;name&gt;!*</SPAN> or find all objects of a certain type, such as
  the Riemann tensor, with <SPAN class="c1">!*R</SPAN>. Objects selected in
  this way are displayed regardless of the nodir flags.</P>
  <P>For metrics, the setmetric() function uses nodir() to hide the metric
  that was previously the current-metric, dir() will not display that metric
  or any of its family until it is again the current-metric or it appears as
  an explicit argument to dir(). This is intended to keep the directory
  listing short and concise, rather than being cluttered by objects that are
  not currently in use.</P>
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">iprop()</SPAN></B>Each indexed object carries a
  large number of properties describing the objects' structure and
  characteristics, these are described in ยง<A href=
  "node19.html#sseciobprops">2.2.6</A>. The function iprop() will display
  those properties named in the iprop!*!* variable, the defaults are
  specially marked in ยง<A href="node19.html#sseciobprops">2.2.6</A>. If the
  switch iprop is on, then iprop() is called whenever the user has requested
  a display of the object's values.</P>
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">rem(), remi()</SPAN></B>The rem() functions are used
  to remove indexed objects from the system, deleting all of their properties
  and values. With rem() the user can delete specified objects, remi()
  deletes objects interactively. Both functions will accept the same patterns
  as dir(), as well as the keyword <SPAN class="c1">all</SPAN> which is a
  synonym for the pattern <SPAN class="c1">!*</SPAN>. Once an object is
  deleted there is no way to recover its values, hence the need for the
  protect() function (qv).</P>
  <P>To use rem(), the user simply types the names of the objects to delete
  as the arguments, so, for example,</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>rem(c1,c2,R);</I>

  (g2_R g2_c2 g2_c1) 
</SPAN></PRE>will remove the Christoffel symbols and the Riemann tensor.
Notice that generic names were used as arguments to rem() but the correct
target objects were deleted, as shown by the displayed list of deleted
objects. If a name that was requested be deleted does not appear in this
list, then the object is kill-protected and cannot be removed until the
protection is cleared with protect(). If a name not of an indexed object is
included in the arguments to rem() it will be ignored.
  <P>In the interactive mode, remi() presents each indexed object specified
  to the user an asks if is to be deleted. Valid responses are <SPAN class=
  "c1">y</SPAN> to delete and move on to the next object, <SPAN class=
  "c1">n</SPAN> to keep the object, <SPAN class="c1">g</SPAN> to go on and
  delete all remaining objects and <SPAN class="c1">q</SPAN> to quit out of
  rem(). Each reponse must be followed by a carriage return; the <SPAN class=
  "c1">g</SPAN> response will cause a further query to ensure the user really
  wants to delete everything.</P>
  <P>Removing certain objects causes the rem() functions to remove others as
  well, so as not to leave orphaned objects in the system. Specifically,
  removing a metric also removes its entire family of objects, while removing
  a parent object causes all of its offspring to be removed. If an indexed
  scalar is removed and it had a value, that value is placed as a normal
  algebraic value on the now non-indexed name.</P>
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">protect()</SPAN></B>The function protect() sets or
  clears an objects' protection flags. The only protections available are
  write-protection, kill-protection, or both. The first argument to protect()
  is the name the object whose protections are being modifed, and the second
  argument sets the new protections (a missing second argument is equivalent
  to <SPAN class="c1">nil</SPAN>). The values for the second argument may be
  one of the following:</P>
  <P><IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tabular1703.png"></P>
  <P>The protection flags are displayed by dir() and by iprop(), however, the
  output from iprop() will show the internal format of the protection flags,
  which are simply the numbers 2, 3, or 6 for write-protection,
  kill-protection, or both, respectively.</P>
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">icopy()</SPAN></B>icopy() The function icopy()
  copies its first argument to a new object whose name is the second
  argument. The new objects' name should be unused; however, if it is an
  unprotected indexed object it will be removed, but its properties are saved
  and can be restored by an immediate call to restoreobj(). The shift
  property of the restoreobj() output will no longer refer to the offspring
  of the input, but all other properties are copied exactly. A more complete
  copy is offered by the function copyfam(), described below.</P>
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">copyfam(), getfam()</SPAN></B>The copyfam() function
  allows the user to copy an object and its entire family (either metric or
  shifted offspring) to another parent. This routine rebuilds the family
  structures of each member so that they all correctly refer to new objects.
  Usually the family of the first named argument is copied to the second
  argument, but, in the case of a metric, the second argument may be omitted
  and the default is the next metric name in the sequence used by metric().
  The copied metric is not made the current-metric.</P>
  <P>A family of objects is primarily a relation such that the offspring
  <A name="1724" id="1724"></A> objects are derived in some manner from the
  parent, either by shifting indices, taking derivatives, or more complicated
  relations such as among the tensor metric and various GR quantities. In
  REDTEN a family is defined by the construction of object names. A family
  member has the parent name, a separating underscore ``<SPAN class=
  "c1">_</SPAN>'', and some further identifying name. These constructions can
  be carried out repeatedly, yielding a family tree of related objects. For
  example, in the dir() listing on page <A href=
  "node44.html#direg"><IMG align="bottom" alt=".png&quot;" src=
  "../../../images/latex/cross_ref_motif.png"></A> one can see that
  <SPAN class="c1">g1</SPAN> is the parent of many objects, while
  <SPAN class="c1">c1</SPAN> is itself the parent of an object, namely
  <SPAN class="c1">g1_c1_DF</SPAN>. The function getfam() will return a lisp
  list of all objects in the family of its argument, including the parent.
  Thus,</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>getfam('g);</I>

 (g1_inv g1_ric g1_R g1_c1 g1_DF g1_c2 g1_c1_DF g1)

#: <I>getfam('c1);</I>

 (g1_c1_DF g1_c1)
</SPAN></PRE>and observe that the argument must be quoted to ensure the
command line is parsed in symbolic mode. Also note that the argument may be
either a generic name or the true name.
  <P>A common use of copyfam() and getfam() is to copy a metric family and
  then apply a consitent set of substitutions to the family without
  disturbing the original set of objects. For example, if <SPAN class=
  "c1">g1</SPAN> is a general spherically symmetric metric with a parameter
  <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6324.png">, and with a family
  of computed objects, then the following will copy the family and substitute
  for <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6324.png">:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>%create g1 and family</I>

#: <I>copyfam(g1);</I>

 g2

#: <I>lisp foreach x in getfam(g2) do write algebraic mapfi(sub(f=1-2*m/r,x));</I>

 &lt;output&gt;

#: <I>lisp foreach x in getfam(g2) do if get (x, 'itype) eq 'odf then 
        write algebraic mapfi (x);</I>

 &lt;output&gt;
</SPAN></PRE>The first foreach can be used to apply a substitution to all
objects in the family, note the use of the write command to ensure that the
mapfi() output is seen, and the use of the algebraic command to change mode
partway along the command line. The second foreach command demonstrates the
application of mapfi() to a specific class of objects, in this case ordinary
derivatives. It is also possible to use these constructs with other list
generating functions or with the indexed!-names list directly, to access all
objects in the system.
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">describe()</SPAN></B>The describe() function is used
  to retrieve or set a string containing a description an object. Most
  generating functions put a description string on their output specifying
  what kind of object has been created, and from what object it was derived.
  A string supplied as the second argument will replace the description on
  the object whose name is the first argument to describe().</P>
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">help()</SPAN></B>The REDTEN help() function
  implements a rudimentary help utility to remind the user of the correct
  number and types of arguments to various REDTEN functions. help() takes any
  number of arguments, which may be patterns of the sort described on page
  <A href="node44.html#patterns"><IMG align="bottom" alt=".png&quot;" src=
  "../../../images/latex/cross_ref_motif.png"></A>; a <SPAN class=
  "c1">!*</SPAN> pattern will show all help strings, while, for example, the
  pattern <SPAN class="c1">!*env</SPAN> will give help for all the functions
  that deal with the REDUCE environment. With no arguments, help() prints a
  list of the names of functions and switches for which help is
  available.</P>
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">defindextype()</SPAN></B>The defindextype() function
  allows the user to define new types of indices or to modify the range of
  the pre-defined index-types. See ยง<A href=
  "node13.html#mkobjindextype">2.2.2</A> for a description of the pre-defined
  index-types and table <A href="node13.html#tabindextype">2.1</A> for their
  properties. The call to defindextype() takes the form:</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class=
"c1">defindextype ('range:<I>int-list</I>, index-type-val:<I>int</I>,
{'name:<I>id</I>}, {'format:<I>string</I>}, {'chsymgen:<I>func</I>});
</SPAN></PRE>where <SPAN class="c1">range</SPAN> is a list of two ordered
non-negative integers representing the range of the indices of type
<SPAN class="c1">index-type-val</SPAN> (the range must consist of
non-negative numbers <IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6326.png">
   ). For example, the default range is <SPAN class="c1">'(0 3)</SPAN> for
  the tensor indices, which have <SPAN class="c1">index-type-val</SPAN> 1.
  For the pre-defined index-types only the range may be changed, other
  arguments after <SPAN class="c1">index-type-val</SPAN> are ignored. For new
  index-types (<SPAN class="c1">index-type-val</SPAN> <IMG align="bottom"
  src="_10787_tex2html_wrap6328.png">), the remaining arguments are: the name
  by which the new index-type is to be known (eg. tensor, spinor, etc.), the
  format in which indices are to be printed, and a function that will
  generate a Christoffel symbol for this index-type for use by cov().
  <P>The <SPAN class="c1">name</SPAN> argument is used by mkobj() to
  determine the indexed property of a new object, different index-types may
  have the same name (such as the spinor or dyad types) so that an apparently
  mixed object will be given a meaningful property. The format is a string
  which must include a '%' mark to indicate the placement of the
  corresponding index element, any other characters are printed literally, so
  for example, the format for the frame indices is ``(%)''. The Christoffel
  symbol generation function is used by cov() to determine the appropriate
  Christoffel symbol to use, some index-types do not have a Christoffel
  symbol, in which case <SPAN class="c1">chsymgen</SPAN> is <SPAN class=
  "c1">'nil</SPAN>. In other cases the function is of the form</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">'(lambda nil (car christoffel2!* '(nil)))
</SPAN></PRE>where <SPAN class="c1">christoffel2!*</SPAN> may be replaced by
whatever is the correct lisp function. This complicated form is required
since the function, following the usual convention, has a return value of the
form <SPAN class="c1">'(name . 1)</SPAN>. It is not really intended that the
casual user be concerned with this.
  <P>defindextype() calls the delta function generator delta() to create or
  modify the system delta functions for the new or updated index-type. If no
  arguments are given, defindextype() prints out the currently defined
  index-types, which are stored in the variable defindextype!*.</P>
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">restrict()</SPAN></B>The indices property of an
  indexed object are derived from the range parameter to defindextype() and
  specify the inclusive group range of the entire index of the object. The
  restrict() function allows the user to narrow this range, so that indexed
  references apply to only a part of the full range. A new property,
  restricted, is placed on the indexed object that is the first argument to
  restrict() (the name must be quoted to ensure parsing in symbolic mode).
  The next two arguments are the lower and upper bounds of the group range,
  these are lists of integers. If either of these arguments is left out, the
  default is the original group range obtained from the indices property on
  the object. Leaving both bounds off returns the group range to that present
  when the object was created, but the restricted property is not removed,
  just set to the new values.</P>
  <P>For most object types, the restricted ranges must be contained within
  the original range. For <SPAN class="c1">array</SPAN> type objects, the
  user can reset the bounds to any desired values. Attempting to access
  components of the object outside the currently defined range, even if they
  are present, will yield 0 from a read or write operation. Indexed
  assignments will apply only to the current range, as will applications of
  mapfi(). The user can therefore work with a restricted section of an
  indexed object, without disturbing the remaining portion of the object.</P>
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">saveobj()</SPAN></B>If the user is about to modify
  an object, the value of that object can be saved by a call to saveobj(). If
  something goes wrong, the object's value can be recovered by calling
  restoreobj(). Only one object at a time can be saved, and the system also
  saves objects during indexed asignments and when mapfi() is used.</P>
  <P><B><SPAN class="c1">mclear()</SPAN></B>The REDTEN hooks in the REDUCE
  parser in some places make use of global variables that control the parsing
  action. If an error has occured or the user has aborted an operation, these
  variables may be left in an inconsistent state. It may then be impossible
  to correctly enter indexed objects and output may be distorted. The
  function mclear() should always be called if the user suspects a parsing
  problem or has forced an abort.</P>
  <P>If a directory listing shows objects with names of the form <SPAN class=
  "c1">#tmp1</SPAN> etc, then an abort has been made, but mclear() still
  needs to be called. These object are the temporaries used by the system
  during the evaluation of an indexed expression.<BR></P>
