<P>
<A NAME=secotherutil>&#160;</A>  There are several functions in REDTEN whose intention is to make
the usage of the system more convenient for the user. Of these
functions, dir() has been previously introduced. 
The function dir() displays the indexed objects in the system,
showing the full name of the object, its type and number of explicit
elements (components), the protection flags, the coordinates and the
index structure. For example, after the Ricci tensor of the Kerr
metric is simplified, a directory shows the following:
<A NAME=direg>&#160;</A>
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>dir(!*);</i>
  name          type          comp    prot  coordinates     indextype
  x             coordinates    4       w    (t r th ph)      (1)
<code>*</code> g1            metric         5       w    (t r th ph)      (-1 -1)
<code>*</code> g1_inv        metric         5       w    (t r th ph)      (1 1)
  g1_ric        ricci          5       w    (t r th ph)      (-1 -1)
  g1_R          riemann        13      w    (t r th ph)      (-1 -1 -1 -1)
  g1_c1         christoffel1   20      w    (t r th ph)      (-1 -1 -1)
  g1_DF         odf            10           (t r th ph)      (-1 -1 -1)
  g1_c2         christoffel2   20      w    (t r th ph)      (1 -1 -1)
  g1_c1_DF      odf            133?         (t r th ph)      (-1 -1 -1 -1)

  9 objects,    Total components: 215

 t

</tt></PRE>Notice that the Ricci tensor has no components, as it should for a
vacuum solution. The current metric and its inverse are flagged by a
leading <tt>*</tt> on the display line. Objects that are implicit have a
<tt>+</tt> symbol following the number of components to indicate that
there are more values than are explicitly stored. Ordinary derivatives
(which are not normally displayed, see &#167;<A HREF="node34.html#secodf">4.1</A>) may have a <tt>?</tt>
following the number of components to indicate that there are
undefined components.  Objects that are write-protected will have a
<tt>W</tt> in the protection column, if they are kill-protected there
will be a <tt>K</tt>, and if they are write- and kill-protected then
there will be a <tt>KW</tt>. If there are no objects in the system, the
message <tt>no objects</tt> is displayed.
<P>
With no arguments dir() shows all objects in order of creation,
any arguments are taken as the names of objects to display alone. If
the switch reversedir is turned off, the display
proceeds in the reverse order, with the most recently created objects
displayed first.  The function nodir() flags objects so that
they do not appear in a directory listing, the flag can be cleared by
calling dir() with the object name as an argument.  Some objects
created by the system, such as the delta-functions, are hidden from
dir() and are never displayed.
<A NAME=4149>&#160;</A>
<A NAME=4150>&#160;</A>
If the keyword <tt>all</tt> is the single argument to dir(), then
all objects are displayed regardless of the nodir flags.  Scalar
objects are not displayed in line with the other objects, their names
are displayed at the end of the listing.
<P>
A rudimentary pattern matcher is used by dir() to expand names
<A NAME=patterns>&#160;</A>
containing certain special characters. A <tt>!*</tt> matches any number
of characters (including none), while a <tt>!?</tt> matches exactly one
character. Thus, the pattern <tt>!*</tt> matches all names and is
equivalent to the keyword <tt>all</tt>. The user can display the family
of a given object with the pattern <tt>&lt;name&gt;!*</tt> or find all objects
of a certain type, such as the Riemann tensor, with <tt>!*R</tt>. Objects
selected in this way are displayed regardless of the nodir flags.
<P>
For metrics, the setmetric() function uses nodir() to hide
the metric that was previously the current-metric, dir() will
not display that metric or any of its family until it is again the
current-metric or it appears as an explicit argument to dir().
This is intended to keep the directory listing short and concise,
rather than being cluttered by objects that are not currently in use.
<P>
<b><tt>iprop()</b></tt>Each indexed object carries a large number of properties describing the
objects' structure and characteristics, these are described in
&#167;<A HREF="node19.html#sseciobprops">2.2.6</A>. The function iprop() will display those properties
named in the iprop!*!* variable, the defaults are specially
marked in &#167;<A HREF="node19.html#sseciobprops">2.2.6</A>. If the switch iprop is on, then iprop()
is called whenever the user has requested a display of the 
object's values.
<P>
<b><tt>rem(), remi()</b></tt>The rem() functions are used to remove indexed objects from the
system, deleting all of their properties and values. With rem()
the user can delete specified objects, remi() deletes objects
interactively. Both functions will accept the same patterns as
dir(), as well as the keyword <tt>all</tt> which is a synonym for the 
pattern <tt>!*</tt>.
Once an object is deleted there is no way to recover its values, hence
the need for the protect() function (qv).
<P>
To use rem(), the user simply types the names of the objects to
delete as the arguments, so, for example,
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>rem(c1,c2,R);</i>

  (g2_R g2_c2 g2_c1) 
</tt></PRE>will remove the Christoffel symbols and the Riemann tensor. Notice
that generic names were used as arguments to rem() but the
correct target objects were deleted, as shown by the displayed list of
deleted objects. If a name that was requested be deleted does not
appear in this list, then the object is kill-protected and cannot be
removed until the protection is cleared with protect().
If a name not of an indexed object is included in the arguments to
rem() it will be ignored.
<P>
In the interactive mode, remi() presents
each indexed object specified to the user an asks if is to be deleted. Valid
responses are <tt>y</tt> to delete and move on to the next object, <tt>n</tt> to keep the object, <tt>g</tt> to go on and delete all remaining
objects and <tt>q</tt> to quit out of rem(). Each reponse must be
followed by a carriage return; the <tt>g</tt> response will cause a
further query to ensure the user really wants to delete everything.
<P>
Removing certain objects causes the rem() functions to remove
others as well, so as not to leave orphaned objects in the system.
Specifically, removing a metric also removes its entire family of
objects, while removing a parent object causes all of its offspring to
be removed.  If an indexed scalar is removed and it had a value, that
value is placed as a normal algebraic value on the now non-indexed
name.
<P>
<b><tt>protect()</b></tt>The function protect() sets or clears an objects' protection
flags. The only protections available are write-protection,
kill-protection, or both. The first argument to protect() is the
name the object whose protections are being modifed, and the second
argument sets the new protections (a missing second argument is
equivalent to <tt>nil</tt>).  The values for the second argument may be
one of the following:
<P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_10787_tabular1703.gif"><P>
<P>
The protection flags are displayed by dir() and by iprop(),
however, the output from iprop() will show the 
internal format of the protection flags, which are simply the numbers
2, 3, or 6 for write-protection, kill-protection, or both,
respectively.
<P>
<b><tt>icopy()</b></tt>icopy()
The function icopy() copies its first argument to a new object
whose name is the second argument. The new objects' name should be
unused; however, if it is an unprotected indexed object it will be
removed, but its properties are saved and can be restored by an
immediate call to restoreobj(). The shift property of the
restoreobj()
output will no longer refer to the offspring of the input, but all
other properties are copied exactly. A more complete copy is offered
by the function copyfam(), described below.
<P>
<b><tt>copyfam(), getfam()</b></tt>The copyfam() function allows the user to copy an object and its
entire family (either metric or shifted offspring) to another parent.
This routine rebuilds the family structures of each member so that
they all correctly refer to new objects. Usually the family of the
first named argument is copied to the second argument, but, in the
case of a metric, the second argument may be omitted and the default
is the next metric name in the sequence used by metric(). The
copied metric is not made the current-metric.
<P>
A family of objects is primarily a relation such that the offspring
<A NAME=1724>&#160;</A>
objects are derived in some manner from the parent, either by shifting
indices, taking derivatives, or more complicated relations such as
among the tensor metric and various GR quantities. In REDTEN a
family is defined by the construction of object names. A family member
has the parent name, a separating underscore ``<tt>_</tt>'', and some
further identifying name. These constructions can be carried out
repeatedly, yielding a family tree of related objects. For example, in
the dir() listing on page <A HREF="node44.html#direg"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="../../../images/latex/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> one can see that <tt>g1</tt> is the
parent of many objects, while <tt>c1</tt> is itself the parent of an
object, namely <tt>g1_c1_DF</tt>. The function getfam() will return
a lisp list of all objects in the family of its argument, including the
parent. Thus,
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>getfam('g);</i>

 (g1_inv g1_ric g1_R g1_c1 g1_DF g1_c2 g1_c1_DF g1)

#: <i>getfam('c1);</i>

 (g1_c1_DF g1_c1)
</tt></PRE>and observe that the argument must be quoted to ensure the command
line is parsed in symbolic mode. Also note that the argument may be
either a generic name or the true name.
<P>
A common use of copyfam() and getfam() is to copy a metric
family and then apply a consitent set of substitutions to the family
without disturbing the original set of objects. For example, if <tt>g1</tt> is a general spherically symmetric metric with a parameter <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_10787_tex2html_wrap6324.gif">,
and with a family of computed objects, then the following will copy
the family and substitute for <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_10787_tex2html_wrap6324.gif">:
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>%create g1 and family</i>

#: <i>copyfam(g1);</i>

 g2

#: <i>lisp foreach x in getfam(g2) do write algebraic mapfi(sub(f=1-2*m/r,x));</i>

 &lt;output&gt;

#: <i>lisp foreach x in getfam(g2) do if get (x, 'itype) eq 'odf then 
        write algebraic mapfi (x);</i>

 &lt;output&gt;
</tt></PRE>The first foreach can be used to apply a substitution to all
objects in the family, note the use of the write command to
ensure that the mapfi() output is seen, and the use of the
algebraic command to change mode partway along the command line. The 
second foreach command demonstrates the application of
mapfi() to a specific class of objects, in this case ordinary 
derivatives. It is also possible to use these constructs with other
list generating functions or with the indexed!-names list
directly, to access all objects in the system.
<P>
<b><tt>describe()</b></tt>The describe() function is used to retrieve or set a string
containing a description an object. Most generating functions put
a description string on their output specifying what kind of object
has been created, and from what object it was derived. A string
supplied as the second argument will replace the description on the
object whose name is the first argument to describe().
<P>
<b><tt>help()</b></tt>The REDTEN help() function implements a rudimentary help
utility to remind the user of the correct number and types of
arguments to various REDTEN functions. help() takes any
number of arguments, which may be patterns of the sort described on
page <A HREF="node44.html#patterns"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="../../../images/latex/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>; a <tt>!*</tt> pattern will show all help strings, while, for
example, the pattern <tt>!*env</tt> will give help for all the functions
that deal with the REDUCE environment. With no arguments,
help() prints a list of the names of functions and switches for
which help is available.
<P>
<b><tt>defindextype()</b></tt>The defindextype() function allows the user to define new types
of indices or to modify the range of the pre-defined
index-types. See &#167;<A HREF="node13.html#mkobjindextype">2.2.2</A> for a description of the pre-defined
index-types and table <A HREF="node13.html#tabindextype">2.1</A> for their properties. The call to
defindextype() takes the form: 
<PRE> 
<tt>defindextype ('range:<i>int-list</i>, index-type-val:<i>int</i>,
{'name:<i>id</i>}, {'format:<i>string</i>}, {'chsymgen:<i>func</i>});
</tt></PRE>where <tt>range</tt> is a list of two ordered non-negative integers
representing the range of the indices of type <tt>index-type-val</tt>
(the range must consist of non-negative numbers <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_10787_tex2html_wrap6326.gif">).
For example, the default range is <tt>'(0 3)</tt> for the tensor indices,
which have <tt>index-type-val</tt> 1. For the pre-defined index-types
only the range may be changed, other arguments after <tt>index-type-val</tt> are ignored. For new index-types (<tt>index-type-val</tt>
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_10787_tex2html_wrap6328.gif">), the remaining arguments are: the name by which the new
index-type is to be known (eg. tensor, spinor, etc.), the format in
which indices are to be printed, and a function that will generate a
Christoffel symbol for this index-type for use by cov().
<P>
The <tt>name</tt> argument is used by mkobj() to determine the
indexed property of a new object, different index-types may have
the same name (such as the spinor or dyad types) so that an apparently
mixed object will be given a meaningful property. The format is a
string which must include a '%' mark to indicate the placement of the
corresponding index element, any other characters are printed
literally, so for example, the format for the frame indices is
``(%)''. The Christoffel symbol generation function is used by
cov() to determine the appropriate Christoffel symbol to use,
some index-types do not have a Christoffel symbol, in which case <tt>chsymgen</tt> is <tt>'nil</tt>. In other cases the function is of the form
<PRE> 
<tt>'(lambda nil (car christoffel2!* '(nil)))
</tt></PRE>where <tt>christoffel2!*</tt> may be replaced by whatever is the correct
lisp function. This complicated form is required since the function,
following the usual convention, has a return value of the form <tt>'(name . 1)</tt>. It is not really intended that the casual user be
concerned with this.
<P>
defindextype() calls the delta function generator delta()
to create or modify the system delta functions for the new or updated
index-type.  If no arguments are given, defindextype() prints
out the currently defined index-types, which are stored in the
variable defindextype!*.
<P>
<b><tt>restrict()</b></tt>The indices property of an indexed object are derived from the
range parameter to defindextype() and specify the inclusive
group range of the entire index of the object. The restrict()
function allows the user to narrow this range, so that indexed
references apply to only a part of the full range. A new property,
restricted, is placed on the indexed object that is the first
argument to restrict() (the name must be quoted to ensure
parsing in symbolic mode). The next two arguments are the lower and
upper bounds of the group range, these are lists of integers. If
either of these arguments is left out, the default is the original
group range obtained from the indices property on the object.
Leaving both bounds off returns the group range to that present when
the object was created, but the restricted property is not
removed, just set to the new values.
<P>
For most object types, the restricted ranges must be contained within
the original range. For <tt>array</tt> type objects, the user can reset
the bounds to any desired values. Attempting to access components of
the object outside the currently defined range, even if they are
present, will yield 0 from a read or write operation. Indexed
assignments will apply only to the current range, as will applications
of mapfi(). The user can therefore work with a restricted
section of an indexed object, without disturbing the remaining portion
of the object.
<P>
<b><tt>saveobj()</b></tt>If the user is about to modify an object, the value of that object can
be saved by a call to saveobj(). If something goes wrong, the
object's value can be recovered by calling restoreobj(). Only one
object at a time can be saved, and the system also saves objects
during indexed asignments and when mapfi() is used.
<P>
<b><tt>mclear()</b></tt>The REDTEN hooks in the REDUCE parser  in some places make use
of global variables that control the parsing action. If an
error has occured or the user has aborted an operation, these
variables may be left in an inconsistent state. It may then be
impossible to correctly enter indexed objects and output may be
distorted. The function mclear() should always be called  if the
user suspects a parsing problem or has forced an abort.
<P>
If a directory listing shows objects with names of the form <tt>#tmp1</tt> etc, then an abort has been made, but mclear() still
needs to be called. These object are the temporaries used by the
system during the evaluation of an indexed expression.
