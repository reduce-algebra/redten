  <P>Unlike ordinary differentiation, which requires only the coordinate
  names, covariant differentiation requires the existence of Christoffel
  symbols of the second kind, and hence of a metric. Covariant
  differentiation is accomplised by first taking the ordinary derivative of
  the object in question, and then forming contractions of each of the
  objects' indices with those of the Christoffel symbol:</P>
  <P><IMG align="bottom" src="_10787_eqnarray1246.png"></P>
  <P>It is apparent from this definition that covariant derivatives are
  non-trivial to compute. Although for a simple metric like RW it takes only
  a few seconds to compute the covariant derivative of the Riemann tensor,
  for more complicated metrics it can take quite some time; and higher level
  derivatives can take several minutes to compute even for simple
  metrics.</P>
  <P>The <SPAN class="c1">||</SPAN> operator placed in an objects' index
  causes the covariant derivative to be computed when the object is involved
  in an indexed assignment. The function cov(), which is also callable by the
  user and takes an indexed object as its single argument, is used to do the
  computation. The output is the name of an indexed object in the form
  <SPAN class="c1">&lt;input&gt;_CD&lt;#&gt;</SPAN>, where <SPAN class=
  "c1">&lt;#&gt;</SPAN> is an integer that distinguishes higher order
  derivatives. The covariant derivative will have the same symmetries as the
  input, and the same index structure with the addition of a single covariant
  tensor index. The covariant derivative is stored on the input object's
  property list under the key cov, in the same format as used for ordinary
  derivatives; whenever cov() is called it looks there first to determine if
  the covariant derivative object already exists.</P>
  <P>Although the user can indicate multiple covariant derivatives, as in
  <SPAN class="c1">T[a,b,||e,f]</SPAN>, cov() computes them individually;
  higher order derivatives have the order appended to the name, as noted
  above. The argument to cov() can include an index, but it is not used
  except to determine if a shift is also being requested (see below). Note
  that any index used in the argument to cov() should <EM>not</EM> contain
  the covariant derivative operator <SPAN class="c1">||</SPAN> or an extra
  index, since the index applies to the object whose derivative is being
  computed. The printed output of a covariant derivative is similar to that
  for ordinary derivatives: the printname is that of the parent and the index
  is printed with the covariant derivative operator in place.</P>
  <P>As with the ordinary derivative, a fixed index including a covariant
  derivative operator may be applied to an object to access the specified
  value, but only after the covariant derivative has been computed. If it has
  not, the operation returns unevaluated.</P>

</SPAN></PRE>Covariant differentiation is not restricted to tensors alone,
objects with other types of indices may also be arguments to cov(). In each
case the single new index will be a covariant tensor index. The Christoffel
symbols used are computed by functions attached to each index-type by
defindextype(); for tensor indices the Christoffel symbols are computed by
christoffel2(), for spinor indices by the function spchristoffel(), neither
frame nor dyad indices have Christoffel symbols. In these cases the covariant
derivative reduces to the ordinary derivative. Covariant differentiation is
not defined for array indices.
  <P>To ensure the correct Christoffel symbols (and the correct coordinates
  for ordinary differentiation) are used, cov() will change the
  current-metric to that specified on the altmetric property of the input.
  When christoffel2() is called to compute or find the second Christoffel
  symbols, it will look at that metric under the christoffel2 property for
  the name of an indexed object with the proper index structure (i.e.
  <SPAN class="c1">'(1 -1 -1)</SPAN>). In the example of the last chapter,
  since christoffel2() was not called by the user it would not have found a
  pre-made object, and would have attempted to compute it. This could have
  been prevented by the command</P>
  <PRE> 
<SPAN class="c1">#: <I>lisp put ('h, 'christoffel2, 'hc2);</I>

 hc2
</SPAN></PRE>Some objects, specifically metrics and the Einstein tensor, have
known covariant derivatives, namely 0. The functions that create metrics put
the value 0 under the cov property so that cov() will immediately return 0.
