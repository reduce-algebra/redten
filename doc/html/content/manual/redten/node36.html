Unlike ordinary differentiation, which requires only the coordinate
names, covariant differentiation requires the existence of Christoffel
symbols of the second kind, and hence of a metric. Covariant
differentiation is accomplised by first taking the ordinary derivative
of the object in question, and then forming contractions of each of
the objects' indices with those of the Christoffel symbol:
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_10787_eqnarray1246.gif"><P>
It is apparent from this definition that covariant derivatives are
non-trivial to compute. Although for a simple metric like RW it takes
only a few seconds to compute the covariant derivative of the Riemann
tensor, for more complicated metrics it can take quite some time; and
higher level derivatives can take several minutes to compute even for
simple metrics.
<P>
The <tt>||</tt> operator placed in an objects' index causes the covariant
derivative to be computed when the object is involved in an indexed
assignment. The function cov(), which is also callable by the
user and takes an indexed object as its single argument, is used to do
the computation. The output is the name of an indexed object in the
form <tt>&lt;input&gt;_CD&lt;#&gt;</tt>, where <tt>&lt;#&gt;</tt> is an integer that
distinguishes higher order derivatives. The covariant derivative will
have the same symmetries as the input, and the same index structure
with the addition of a single covariant tensor index. The covariant
derivative is stored on the input object's property list under the key
cov, in the same format as used for ordinary derivatives;
whenever cov() is called it looks there first to determine if the
covariant derivative object already exists.
<P>
Although the user can indicate multiple covariant derivatives, as in
<tt>T[a,b,||e,f]</tt>, cov() computes them individually; higher
order derivatives have the order appended to the name, as noted above.
The argument to cov() can include an index, but it is not used
except to determine if a shift is also being requested (see below).
Note that any index used in the argument to cov() should <em>not</em> contain the covariant derivative operator <tt>||</tt> or an extra
index, since the index applies to the object whose derivative is being
computed.  The printed output of a covariant derivative is similar to
that for ordinary derivatives: the printname is that of the parent and
the index is printed with the covariant derivative operator in place.
<P>
As with the ordinary derivative, a fixed index including a covariant
derivative operator may be applied to an object to access the
specified value, but only after the covariant derivative has been
computed. If it has not, the operation returns unevaluated.
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>cov(g1_R);</i>
  computing g1_R_CD

 g1_R_CD

#: <i>g1_R[1,0,1,0,||0];</i>

 rt    rt - rt    rt
   t,3        t,2   t

</tt></PRE>Covariant differentiation is not restricted to tensors alone, objects
with other types of indices may also be arguments to cov(). In
each case the single new index will be a covariant tensor index. The
Christoffel symbols used are computed by functions attached to each
index-type by defindextype(); for tensor indices the Christoffel
symbols are computed by christoffel2(), for spinor indices by
the function spchristoffel(), neither frame nor dyad indices
have Christoffel symbols. In these cases the covariant derivative
reduces to the ordinary derivative. Covariant differentiation is not
defined for array indices.
<P>
To ensure the correct Christoffel symbols (and the correct coordinates
for ordinary differentiation) are used, cov() will change the
current-metric to that specified on the altmetric property of
the input. When christoffel2() is called to compute or find the
second Christoffel symbols, it will look at that metric under the
christoffel2 property for the name of an indexed object with the 
proper index structure (i.e. <tt>'(1 -1 -1)</tt>). In the example of the
last chapter, since christoffel2() was not called by the user it
would not have found a pre-made object, and would have attempted to
compute it. This could have been prevented by the command
<PRE> 
<tt>#: <i>lisp put ('h, 'christoffel2, 'hc2);</i>

 hc2
</tt></PRE>Some objects, specifically metrics and the Einstein tensor, have
known covariant derivatives, namely 0. The functions that create
metrics put the value 0 under the cov property so that
cov() will immediately return 0.
