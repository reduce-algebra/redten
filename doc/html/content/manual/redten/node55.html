<A NAME=ssecdisk>&#160;</A>   In addition to saving environments within the system, REDTEN
includes a package to allow the user to save an environment to disk
for later use.  The same data structures are used to find the names of
things to save, and all stored environments  are also saved. This
package was intended primarily for the saving of indexed objects and
the environment in which they were created, so that they could be
re-introduced into a subsequent REDUCE session.
<P>
There are two routines in the disk-saving package: savei() and
savec(). savei() is used to save indexed objects in
internal form, so that they may be used again in normal fashion.
 savec() is
similar to savei() in terms of saving the environment, but saves
indexed objects in component form: new variables of the form <tt>&lt;name&gt;&lt;index&gt;</tt> are created, each holding a component of the object
<tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> with fixed index <tt>&lt;index&gt;</tt>. When reloaded, the
components of these objects must be used as normal algebraic
variables, the indexed-object structure is no longer present.
<P>
Both of these routines save the entire current REDUCE environment,
and any saved environments. The required first argument of each is a
file name conforming to the local conventions about such, usually it
will be a string enclosed in double quotes. Any remaining arguments
are taken to be the names of indexed objects, and patterns may be
used. The output file contains lisp code and can be re-read via the
usual REDUCE in() command. During both the save and reload
operations, the name of each saved or restored symbol is echoed to
the screen.
